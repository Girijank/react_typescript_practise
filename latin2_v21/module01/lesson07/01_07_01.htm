    <h1>The Roman Monarchy</h1>

    <p>Over the next few lessons, you will learn about the seven kings of Rome in the Roman monarchy which lasted from
      753 BCE–509 BCE.</p>

    <p>As you are reading the stories below, keep in mind that the history of Rome is a combination of both mythical
      and historical tales. Let's start with Romulus, Rome's legendary first king.</p>

        <h4>Romulus, 1<sup>st</sup> King of Rome</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>Only one person could become the king of Rome. However, both Romulus and Remus wanted the throne! So, they
          both turned to the gods and omens to decide. Romulus, standing on the Palatine Hill and Remus, on the Aventine
          Hill, both looked in the sky and used the tradition of <span class="glossary">augury</span> to determine who
          should rule Rome. Romulus saw six birds fly above him first. Then, Remus saw 12 birds. They couldn’t agree on
          what was better&mdash;seeing birds first or seeing more birds! So, they both began to build their own cities,
          making themselves the leader of their own dominion. But Romulus, angered by Remus’s success, jumped over the
          walls of Remus’s city and killed him, leaving only one twin to rule the land. Success! In 753 BCE, Romulus was
          now the king and so he named his kingdom after himself&mdash;Rome!</p>

        <h4>Titus Tatius</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>In some stories, Romulus also shared the crown with Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, a neighboring tribe.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>As the king of Rome, Romulus needed to populate the city. So, he opened his doors to all types of
            folk&mdash;robbers, beggars, murderers (not the best of people). Romulus didn’t care&mdash;he needed people
            in his city. </li>
          <li>Thus, Romulus devised a plan to go to the neighboring city of Sabina to invite all its men over for a
            party. While the Sabine men partied in Rome, Romulus and his Romans snuck into the Sabine city and stole all
            of the women away and made them marry the Roman men. </li>
          <li>The Sabine king, Titus Tatius, was mortified, but instead of starting a costly war with Rome, Titus Tatius
            agreed as a peace offering to co-rule Rome with Romulus.</li>
