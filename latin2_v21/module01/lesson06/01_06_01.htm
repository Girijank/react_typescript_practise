        <p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion Based Assessment&mdash;DBA</strong>. </p>
        <p>Now you know about the historical and mythical founding of Rome from the journey of Aeneas to the
          first Roman king, Romulus. You also reviewed your Latin 1 noun and verb translation skills and learned all about
          Active versus Passive Voice. You should now be familiar with how to conjugate verbs in the Present System
          Passive Voice and translate sentences using the Ablative of Agent. </p>
        <p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss these topics with your instructor. Talking about (and in) a
          foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to practice on
          your own before your discussion assessment—the more you speak, the more at ease you will feel. Time to dust
          off this "ancient" language and give it a whirl! </p>
        <p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact
          your teacher.</p>
