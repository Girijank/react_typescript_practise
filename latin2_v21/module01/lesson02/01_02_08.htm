  <h1>Trojan Romans?</h1>
  <h4><span class="t1"><em>'Was this the face that launched a thousand ships<br />

      <p>Rome's origin story begins with the mythical story of Aeneas, the mythical Trojan leader, who after the fall of Troy sailed to Italy to find a new city for his family and heritage. Aeneas landed in the city of Alba Longa. The story goes that Alba Longa was founded by Romulus, the son of the mythical god Mars and the vestal priestess Rhea Silvia.</p>
      <p>Since the Trojan War begins our Rome's "origin story," why don't we grab a great snack and read about the greatest mythological story ever told&mdash;the Trojan War?</p>

      <p>Once upon a time, three Olympian goddesses, Venus, Juno, and Minerva, quarreled about who
        was most
        beautiful.  To resolve the dispute, they enlisted Paris as mediator (a young shepherd who also
        happened to be a Trojan prince). Secretly, all three goddesses tried various enticements to sway his
        decision&mdash;and one succeeded. While Minerva offered wisdom and Juno, power, Venus offered to him
        the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, <em><span class="glossary">pulcherrima omnium feminarum.</span></em></p>

      <p>Her marriage to another king, Menelaus, did not concern Paris, who traveled to Sparta and whisked her
        away to his home back in Troy. Her husband, enraged by the offense, called upon his allies to
        besiege Troy. Bound by oath, they sailed for Troy and camped on its shores. Hence the famous
        expression "the face that launched a thousand ships."  The war dragged on for years. Great heroes
        perished in the many battles including each side's most cherished champions: Achilles, on the Greek
        side, and Hector of the Trojans.</p>
      <p>After ten years of war, a plan was devised: they would pretend to sail back home! One man was left
        behind to claim the Greeks had left behind an offering to the gods&mdash;an enormous wooden horse (a
        trick, of course). The Trojans dragged this "gift" inside the city walls, convinced the other Greeks
        had abandoned the war. <em><span class="glossary">Donum fuit ingens equus ligneus!</span></em></p>

          alt="Picture of Gates of Mycenae" data-caption="Gates of Mycenae" />
      <p>Late in the evening, the soldiers, who had been hiding inside the hollow interior of the horse, crept
        out and opened the gates. Naturally, none of the troops had really sailed home.  They had turned
        right around in the night and were waiting outside the gates. Once the gates opened, they stormed
        through and slaughtered the unsuspecting inhabitants. <em><span class="glossary">Pauci Troani pugnam superfuit.</span></em></p>
      <p>The most famous survivor was Aeneas, who managed to escape with his father and young son. He would later
        become the legendary founder of Rome! The great city of Troy, though, disappeared from history, leaving
        behind only a trace of its memory in the myth of the Trojan War.</p>
