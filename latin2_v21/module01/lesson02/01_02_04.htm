        <p>I am a champion of women's rights and empowerment. I comforted women during their marriages and
          childbirth, and I served as a guardian angel for married women. Every year on March 1<sup>st</sup>,
          Roman women marched to the Temple of Juno on the Capitoline Hill to worship me. <em><span
                class="glossary">Feminae mihi dona, oves et boves dant</span></em>. They also
          conducted rituals at my temple.</p>
        <p>Every year on July 7<sup>th</sup>, in another festival, the <em>Nonae Caprotinae</em>, or "The Nones
          of the Wild Fig," women marched to the Campus Martius to make offerings and sacrifices to me in
          celebration of my protection over them.</p>

        <h3><em>Cogitemus! (Let's think about it!)</em></h3>
        <p>Based on what you read about these festivals and ceremonies, why do you think June is known as the
          "month for marriages?"</p>
