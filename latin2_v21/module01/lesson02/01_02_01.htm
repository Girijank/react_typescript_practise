        <p>The Romans loved a good story, especially stories about
          heroic warriors and gods and goddesses battling amongst themselves and against mere mortals.</p>

    <p>The Trojan War was an actual war that occurred around 1260 BCE between the Greeks and the
      Trojans (a people who lived in Troy, which is in modern day Turkey). Thanks to writers,
      this war became the greatest fictional story ever told! It also became part of Rome's
      foundation story.</p>
    <p>Many Romans looked to the Greek stories of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>
      and the Roman story <em>The Aeneid</em> as stories about their Roman heritage. They believed that they were the descendants of the Trojan hero, Aeneas, and those who escaped from the burning Troy. <em><span class="glossary">Post decem annos in mari, viri ad Troiam pervenient.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p>Classical writers rooted Rome's foundation story in mythology as much as in historical truth. This concept is known as <em><span class="glossary">verisimilitude</span></em>&mdash;a type of writing style that allows a writer to write history as close to historical truth as possible, but with
      added
      non-factual information for story embellishment. This is why the story of the Trojan War can be
      viewed as both actual and fictional.</p>

              <p><strong>How did the Greeks influence Rome’s mythological history? </strong></p>
              <p>Like many people today, the ancient Romans enjoyed a variety of forms of entertainment.
                From chariot races to gladiatorial contests, the Romans relished watching the games.
                However, the Romans also enjoyed listening to and reading literature on a variety of
                topics. One of the Romans’ favorite genres was epic poetry, and two of the most
                celebrated epic poems in antiquity were the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>,
                poems about the Trojan War and its aftermath. </p>
              <p>According to tradition, both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> were composed by
                the blind Greek poet, Homer, around 1100 BCE, four hundred years before the founding of
                Rome. </p>

            <div class="col-xs-8 mb-10">
              <p><strong>The Iliad</strong></p>
              <p>In the <em>Iliad</em>, the Greeks were fighting the Trojans because Paris, one of the
                Trojan king Priam’s sons, abducted Queen Helen of Sparta after falling in love with her.
                The king of Sparta, Menelaus, was enraged by this act and along with his brother,
                Agamemnon, and an alliance of Greek kings and their armies, waged war against the
                Trojans. Throughout the story, Greek heroes like Achilles battled Trojan heroes like
                Hector. The Olympian gods and goddesses also took an active role in the fighting, with
                some favoring the Greeks and others favoring the Trojans.</p>
              <p>Using the Trojan horse, the Greeks were ultimately able to capture and defeat Troy with
                only a handful of Trojans escaping. One of these Trojans was the Dardanian prince,
                Aeneas. </p>

              <p><strong>The Odyssey </strong></p>
              <p>The <em>Odyssey</em>, another poem attributed to Homer, concerns the aftermath of the
                Trojan War and Odysseus, the Greek king of Ithaca, who is trying to return home. Over
                the course of his journey, Odysseus encountered many creatures like the cyclops,
                Polyphemus, and the witch, Circe. Eventually, Odysseus returned home to Ithaca only to
                fight unwelcome Greek suitors who desire his kingdom.</p>

              <p><strong>The Aeneid </strong></p>
              <p>For centuries, these stories were handed down and inspired many writers. One of these
                writers was the Roman writer, Vergil who modeled his own epic poem, the <em>Aeneid</em>,
                after Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. In Vergil’s story, the Trojan prince
                Aeneas, who was a minor figure in Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>, becomes the main character.
                Like Odysseus, Aeneas goes on a series of sea adventures before making his way to Italy.
              </p>
              <p>Vergil wrote the <em>Aeneid</em> nearly 700 years after the founding of Rome in 753 BCE
                and 1300 years after the actual Trojan War.</p>
