				<p>Congrats! You have mastered how to conjugate and translate
					verbs in the six tenses: Present, Imperfect, Future, Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect.</p>
			</div>

		<p>Review your <a href="pop/03_03_notes.htm" class="modal-pop">Verb Guide</a> to refresh your memory of the
			terms
			you should know when dealing with Latin verbs.

			<p>Did you know that you have been conjugating and translating verbs in what we call the Active Voice all
				along?
				Did you know, there is another voice to learn? <strong>It is called the Passive Voice!</strong> </p>
			<p><strong>Let’s first review what “voice” is:</strong> </p>
			<p>The voice of the verb tells you whether the subject does the action, or if the subject is receiving the
				action
				of the verb. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> In the Active Voice, the subject does the action (e.g., <em>amas</em>
					= you
					love). </li>
				<li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> In the Passive Voice, the action instead happens to the subject
					(e.g.,
					<em>amaris</em> = you are being loved).</li>
			</ul>

					<p>Latin sentences can either be in the Active Voice or in the Passive Voice. </p>
					<hr />
					<p>Any verb tense can have the Active Voice or Passive Voice. </p>
					<hr />
					<p>In Latin, the subject is shown by the person and number indicated by the verb ending.</p>
					<hr />
					<p>Latin has separate endings for the Passive Voice for each verb tense so that you can easily see
						the
						difference of a voice in a sentence, which will make it very easy for you to translate. </p>

					<h3>Juno's Note: Passive Voice Translation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The Passive form is often shown with a “be/being/been” in translation.<br>
							<p>Example: I am <strong>being</strong> praised; “being” is called an auxiliary verb.</p>
						</li>
						<li>The main verb in the passive voice will never have an “-ing” as its ending in English.
							<p>Example:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Active: I am prais<strong>ing</strong>. </li>
								<li>Passive: I am being praised. = no “-ING” </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
