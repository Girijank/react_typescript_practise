    <h2>Present System Passive Voice&mdash;Text Version</h2>	 
   
    <p>Announcer: Let’s talk about the Present System Passive Voice.  </p>
    <p>In the Passive Voice, the subject receives the action of the verb, rather than completing the action. The present system Passive does so in three tenses: present, imperfect, and future.</p>
    <p>The first piece of the present system, Passive Voice puzzle is your present stem—the 2nd principal part, minus the -re.</p>
    <p>The next piece of the puzzle is the Passive personal endings (-r, -ris, -tur, -mur, -mini, -ntur).</p>
    <p>Added to your present stem, this piece forms a present tense, Passive Voice verb. </p>
    <p>Remember, in the Passive Voice, the subject receives the action of the verb.</p>
    <p>Villa ab agricola aedificatur. The farmhouse is being built by the farmer.</p>
    <p>We use the "-tur" ending to indicate present tense, 3rd person, singular because the house is being built. The house is receiving the action.</p>
    <p>The imperfect tense, Passive Voice uses the same pieces –the present stem and Passive Voice personal endings, with a new piece in between—the imperfect "ba". </p>
    <p>Aedificatur becomes aedificabatur—the farmhouse was being built by the farmer.</p>
    <p>In the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> conjugation, the future tense Passive Voice uses bor, beris, bitur, bimur, bimini and buntur to indicate "will be," like in the sentence Villa ab agricola aedificabitur.  The farmhouse will be built by the farmer.</p>
    <p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> conjugations use the same "ie" piece as the future Active Voice, with Passive Voice personal endings added on, like in Villa ab agricola munietur. The farmhouse will be fortified by the farmer.</p>
    <p>In all of the examples, no matter how the tense of verb endings changes, just remember that the subject receives the action!</p>
