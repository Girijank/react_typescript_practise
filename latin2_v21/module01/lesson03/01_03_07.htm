        <p>I am the queen of the gods and wield much power. In the Trojan War, I was on the side of the Greeks
          and continuously helped my beloved Greeks in battle. At one point in the war, my Greeks were so wearied
          that they had proposed to abandon their efforts and return to Greece.
          <em><span class="glossary">Consilium eos adiuvare cogitavi.</span></em> I noticed my husband, Jupiter, a mercurial fan of the Trojans,
          perched on Mt. Ida keeping an attentive eye on the Trojan battlefield. I knew that I needed to distract his
          gaze. So, I first tricked my sister Venus to give me her magical girdle; then, I persuaded the god of Sleep
          to follow me to Mt. Ida. There, with my loving charm and Sleep by my side, I enchanted Jupiter and lulled
          him to sleep.

              <p>At that very time, my brother, Neptune, and I helped the Greeks to fight the Trojans.</p>

           <p>The great Greek Ajax knocked down the Trojan warrior Hector who then
          had to retreat, leaving the Trojans without their fearless leader. As a result, my Greeks were able to kill
          many Trojans that day and gain momentum in battle.</p>
