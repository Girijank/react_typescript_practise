      <p>I am Queen of the gods &mdash; fabulous, powerful, and
        majestic. However, I am known for my temper
        and ire, jealousy, and my watchful eye on my husband, Jupiter. In my opinion, my vengeful
        personality is justified &mdash; just don’t cross me and you’ll be fine! Listen to my story about
        how I took out revenge on the river nymph Io.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In my beloved Greek land of Argos, my husband, Jupiter, had seized the river nymph, Io, daughter of the river god Inachus. I flew down to Argos to catch my husband, but before I could find him, he covered the land in a thick mist and turned Io into a cow. </p>

        <!-- <div class="collapse"> -->
        <p class="mt-1">At first, I actually felt compassion for the cow and told Jupiter to give the cow to me. My
          husband was reluctant to do so because he was afraid that I would find out about his love for Io. I
          thought it best I keep a close eye on Io, so I gave the cow to Argus of the 100 eyes to watch over her.
          Argus never let Io out of his one hundred eyes’ sight until one day she wandered off to the bank of her
          father’s river. She gazed into the river water and finally realized that she was a cow and no longer a
          maiden. She cried out to her father who was devastated by his daughter’s transformation! Argos found Io, and brought her back to his lair, but Jupiter wanted Io for himself again. <em><span class="glossary">Iupiter Mercurium necare Argum demisit.</span></em> I was furious when Mercury
          killed Argus. I wanted revenge on my husband. I scooped up Argus’ one hundred eyes and placed them as
          jewels on the tail feathers of my favorite bird, the peacock. Then, I sent a gadfly to chase Io around
          everyday all across the earth which drove her crazy. <em><span class="glossary">Io trans Europam multos annos erravit.</span></em> Jupiter had to beg me to stop my vengeful actions, which I eventually
          did. But I still believe my anger towards Jupiter and Io was justified.</p>
