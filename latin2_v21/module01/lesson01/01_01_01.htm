      <p>So glad you are here to discover majestic Rome! This eternal city sits on the bank of the Tiber River in Italy. You will travel through Rome's history. To do so, we must first begin in the
        Turkish city of Troy, where one of its heroes, Aeneas, will leave the city to establish a "new Troy"
        in Italy. In 753 BCE, his descendent, the mythological King Romulus, will found the city of Rome.
        Then onward, you will explore the glory days of the Roman Republic. The journey ends with the rise
        and fall of the famous Roman Empire. In this course, you will unwrap all the gold that glitters in
        Rome while learning the language that the ancient Romans spoke&mdash;Latin! </p>
      <p><strong>You will learn that Rome was a nation built upon mythical storytelling and actual history.</strong> Early Rome was rich in agricultural farmland. Archeology shows us that it was populated by families living
        in small huts. Yet, ancient Roman literature suggests that the origin of Rome was more magical than that!  According to Roman literature, Rome was founded by the demi-god Romulus. This first king was descended
        from the mythical hero, Aeneas, who escaped the destruction of the Trojan War.</p>
      <p>There is so much to Rome's origin story, and you will have the chance to determine for yourself whether the
        founding and history of Rome was <strong>actual or fictional</strong>.</p>
      <p>While learning your Latin, also have fun learning about the mythical stories that created Rome's "legendary"
        history!</p>
