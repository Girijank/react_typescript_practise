  <h1>Rome's Mytho-history</h1>
  <p class="mt-2">Now let's go on a ride through ancient Rome from its rise in 753 BCE to its fall in 476 CE! On
    this ride, you'll run across Roman kings, gods, mythical figures, heroes, senators, city and country folk,
    warriors, dictators, and emperors who all shaped what we know and love about Rome!</p>
  <div class="row mt-2">

    <div class="col-sm-9">
      <p>As you continue this mytho-historical ride through Rome's history, you'll discover the following.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classical historical writers combined mythological and historical tales to construct a
          mytho-historical account of Rome's beginnings.</li>
        <li>Writers utilized mytho-history to craft a lofty image of Rome as a city birthed from the descendants of gods and a city predestined for greatness. The historical writings are full of mythological moralizing tales and made-up courageous leaders.</li>
        <li>Authors often ignored civilizations such as the Etruscans or Greeks, or even the Carthaginians,
          that contributed to the growth and success of the city of Rome.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Keep these factors in mind as you consider what is really known about the Romans, their history, and the <em>lingua Latina</em>!</p>
