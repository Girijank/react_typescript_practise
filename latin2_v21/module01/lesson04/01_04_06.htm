    <h1>Ablative of Agent</h1>

    <p>We now know that there is a Passive Voice in Latin where the subject is being controlled by someone. Did you
      ever wonder how we are to translate that “by someone” in Latin? We have a special function of the Ablative
      Case for this translation. <strong>It is called the “</strong><strong><span class="glossary">Ablative of
        Agent</span>.”</strong></p>

        <h4>Latin Structure:</h4>
        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>When a subject is acted upon by a person (a human being, not an inanimate object or non-human
            thing), this is expressed in Latin in the Ablative Case preceded by the preposition <strong>a/
              ab</strong> = “by.”</li>
          <li>Thus, a sentence that contains an Ablative of Agent will have these three P's: </li>
          <li class="list">
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Passive verb</strong> </li>
              <li><strong>Preposition</strong> a/ab which is translated as "by" in this construction</li>
              <li><em>a <em>P</em>erson in the Ablative Case following a/ab</em><br>
              English Example: <strong>Mark</strong> is wounded by <strong><em>Luke</em></strong>.<br>
              Latin Structure: <strong>Marcus</strong> a <strong><em>Lucio</em></strong>
              vulneratur. <br>
              Ablative of Agent: <strong>a</strong> Luci<strong><em>o</em></strong>.</li>
