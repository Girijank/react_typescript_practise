        <p>As Queen of the gods, I already knew that Aeneas was predestined to land in Italy and for his descendants to found the city of Rome. <strong>But I did everything in my power to prevent that
            from happening</strong> because I also knew that Aeneas’s descendants, the Roman people, would
          centuries later fight three great wars called the Punic Wars, against my beloved African nation of Carthage.
          <em><span class="glossary">Romani Carthaginem vastabunt.</span></em> Therefore,
          when Aeneas landed
          in Carthage during his journey and fell in love with the beautiful Carthaginian Queen Dido, I tried to make
          that relationship last so that Aeneas would stay in Carthage forever, and there could never be a Rome.</p>
        <p>But Jupiter intervened and sent his son, the messenger god, Mercury, to Aeneas to tell him to abandon
          my Queen Dido, break her heart, and leave Carthage. Aeneas, the coward that he is,
          <em><span class="glossary">in media nocte navigavit</span></em>, leaving my Queen Dido devastated.
          <em><span class="glossary">Eo tempore, perpetuam vindictam petere promisi</span></em> against Aeneas and his
          descendants, the Roman people. This is why
          I brought devastation upon the city of
          Rome during the Punic Wars. </p>
