    <h1>Aeneas Lands in Latium </h1>

    <p>Let’s learn what Vergil had written about Aeneas when he landed in Italy.</p>
    <p>In this reading, we have given you the lines in the actual <em>Aeneid</em> text so that you can read a copy
      of <em>Aeneid</em>
      and know exactly where to go in the story to learn more. This is a great way for you to begin deeper research as a
      Classical Studies student.</p>

        <p>Having just spent the majority of Book six of the <em>Aeneid</em> in the underworld, meeting the figures of
          his past
          and of Rome's future, Aeneas's ship lands in the Tiber river at the start of Book seven (lines
          <strong>1-36</strong>).  Vergil then explains that Latinus, the King of Latium (the part of Italy that will
          become
          Rome), had just received a prophecy that his daughter, Lavinia, would marry a foreigner (lines
          37-106). Latinus takes this prophecy to relate to the just-arrived Trojans. The Trojans then send envoys and
          gifts to Latinus and are welcomed (lines <strong>107-191</strong>). They then gain an alliance
          with Latinus (lines <strong>192-285</strong>) and
          a proposal of marriage with Lavinia. When Juno learns of this, she sends the Allecto, a Fury and goddess of
          rage, to drive Lavinia's mother, Amata, to insanity and suicide (lines <strong>341-405</strong>) and then to
          enrage Turnus who
          had previously been engaged to Lavinia (lines <strong>406-474</strong>).</p>
        <p>The entire rest of the <em>Aeneid</em> will focus on the war
          between the Trojans/Latins and Turnus's army of Rutulians.  The city of Alba Longa in Latium becomes the new
          home for Aeneas and his son, Ascanius. It is here where Ascanius will raise a family who will become the
          ancestors of Romulus and Remus. </p>

        <p>How does the story of Aeneas explain why we call the language of the
          Romans "Latin"? Can you think of any other cultural labels or names we use today that are derived from this
          same story?</p>
