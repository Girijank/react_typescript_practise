<h4>Troy</h4>
<p>Aeneas’s quest to find a new homeland begins as he leads Trojan survivors away from Troy, which
    had just fallen to the Greeks in the Trojan War.</p>
<p>The ancient city of Troy was located in northwestern Anatolia, situated on the Biga Peninsula, an area
    called the Troad in ancient times.</p>
<p>With the aid of topographical features described in the epics of Homer (e.g., nearby Mt. Ida with other
    hills to the east and the sea to the north and west), 19th century archaeological excavations carried
    out by Heinrich Schliemann uncovered a Bronze Age city identified as Homer’s Troy.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Thrace</h4>
<p>Aeneas makes his first stop and first settlement, Aeneadae, in Thrace.</p>
<p>Aeneas quickly abandons Thrace after a warning from Polydorus, who had been transformed into a plant after
    his violent murder. Ancient Thrace sat mostly between the river Strymon to the west and the Black Sea to the
    east, an area now occupied mainly by Bulgaria.</p>
<p>In ancient times, Thrace was considered remote and mysterious to the Greeks and Romans and was famed for its
    horses, Amazon warriors or Amazonicae, and Orphic mystery cults.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Delos</h4>
<p>Aeneas's next stop is Delos. On Delos, Aeneas receives the cryptic oracle, &quot;seek out your
    ancient mother,&quot; at the templum Apollonis.</p>
<p>The island of Delos is located among the Cycladic islands in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>The island was considered the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis who had religious cults there, and it was a
    meeting and treasury site for the Delian league which united Greek states against the Persians during the
    5th century BCE.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Crete</h4>
<p>After Anchises, Aeneas’s father, misinterprets the instructions of Apollo, Aeneas lands on Crete.</p>
<p>Crete is the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. Crete was thought to have been ruled by the mythological
    King Minos.</p>
<p>Because of this, the many Bronze Age archaeological sites, including the palace at Knossos and the civilization that
    built them, are called Minoan.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Strophades</h4>
<p>After leaving Crete, Aeneas and his men are driven to the Strophades by strong storms.</p>
<p>Harpyae(Harpies) attack the Trojans on these islands. Celaeno, the leader of the Harpies, accuses the Trojans of slaughtering
    sacred cattle and warns them that when they reach Italy, they will be so hungry that they will eat their tables.</p>
<p>The Strophades are small islands in the Ionian Sea.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Buthrotum</h4>
<p>In Buthrotum, Aeneas encounters Helenus and his wife, Andromache, both fellow Trojans. Helenus is a priest of Apollo
    and the son of Priam.</p>
<p>Andromache was previously the wife of the Trojan champion Hector and mother of Astyanax, both killed in the war.</p>
<p>Helenus gives a prophecy with warnings of the dangers ahead.</p>
<p>Buthrotum is now called Butrint and is an archaeological site in Albania.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Etna</h4>
<p>While sailing by Etna, the one-eyed Cyclops threatens the Trojans just after an Ithacan warned them of his experience
    with Polyphemus as a member of Odysseus’s crew.</p>
<p>Etna is a tall and active volcano located on the east coast of Sicily. Ancients believed the smoke from the volcano
    came from the workshop of Hephaestus.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Drepanum</h4>
<p>At Drepanum, Aeneas’s father, Anchises, dies.</p>
<p>These are the final details Aeneas gives in his story to Dido at Carthage.</p>
<p>Drepanum is now called Drepana and is located on the western coast of Sicily.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Carthage</h4>
<p>In Carthage, Aeneas meets Dido, founder and Queen of Carthage. Because of Juno and Venus, Aeneas and Dido fall in
    love.</p>
<p>Aeneas’s abandonment of Dido causes her to end her life.</p>
<p>Carthage was located in North Africa and most famously fought three wars (the Punic Wars) with Rome as Rome’s most
    serious rival for dominance in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Rome finally sacked and destroyed Carthage after the third Punic War, ending Carthage’s ability to threaten Roman
    dominance.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Eryx</h4>
<p>The Trojans return to Sicily when they land at Eryx, a mountainous city on the western side of the island.</p>
<p>There Aeneas holds elaborate funeral games for his father, Anchises.</p>
<p>Ancient funeral games involved athletic competitions where winners were awarded prizes.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Cumae</h4>
<p>In Cumae, Aeneas meets the famed Cumaean Sybil who delivered prophecies from a cave.</p>
<p>She guides Aeneas to the underworld where he sees Dido and his father and is given a vision of Rome’s future. Cumae
    is in western Italy in Campania.</p>
<p>Archaeologists have discovered remains of temples on the city’s acropolis and a cavern, which some have identified as
    the cave of the Sybil.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Latium</h4>
<p>Aeneas’s final stop is Latium where he will settle his people. Juno, however, causes war to break out amongst the
    Trojans and the local people before Aeneas can fulfill his destiny.</p>
<p>Latium is located in western Italy north of Cumae.</p>
<p>The Alban hills, including Albanus Mons, were home to the cult of Jupiter Latiaris.</p>
<p><em>&quot;et iuxta genitore mastat Lavinia virgo&quot;</em><br>&quot;and the maiden Lavinia, joined together, stands
    near her father&quot; Vergil, Aeneid, Book 1, line 72</p>
