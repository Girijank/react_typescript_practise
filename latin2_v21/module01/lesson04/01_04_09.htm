          <h4>Romulus and Remus</h4>
          <p>The son of Aeneas, Ascanius, founded a city named Alba Longa under Mount Alban in the
            Latium region. His family ruled the land for many years. From this city, the founder of
            Rome was born. Let’s read more about the founding of Rome, and as you are reading the
            story below, keep in mind that Rome’s history is a combination of both mythical and

            evil brother, Amulius, however, wanted to become king; Numitor is expelled by Amulius from the
            kingdom, and Amulius kills Numitor’s son. He forces Numitor’s daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a
            Vestal Priestess. Vestal Priestesses were not able to produce children, but the god Mars saw and
            loved her! With Mars, Rhea Silvia produces two sons!  Angrily, Numitor orders his soldier to
            kill the twins.</em></p>

            <h4>Translation Checklist</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Have you identified the tense, voice, person, number, and mood of the verb?</li>
              <li>Have you identified the case, number, and gender for the nouns and adjectives?</li>
              <li>Do your English definitions for each of the words in the Latin translation match the
                definitions found in the toolbox dictionary?</li>
              <li>Have you double-checked your Latin vs. English word order?
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>HINT</strong>: In Latin, adjectives follow the nouns they modify, genitive nouns follow
                    the nouns they possess, and verbs are typically found at the end of the
                    sentence. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Did you transfer all punctuation from Latin to English?</li>
