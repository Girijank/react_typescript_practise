      <p><strong>Who were the Etruscans?</strong></p>
      <p>The Etruscans were a thriving, rich, sophisticated civilization who had their own language, kings,
        trade
        empire, and customs. They were especially good in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>manufacturing</li>
        <li>metallurgy</li>
        <li>trade </li>
      </ul>
      <p>They travelled to Rome and brought their customs, traditions, gods, and designing techniques to the early Romans. They became kings of Rome, naturally and strategically. The Romans adopted many of the Etruscans' practices, including their funeral games. At the funerals for wealthy Etruscans, men fought to the death to honor the deceased. The fights became popular amusement at funerals and transcended into the pomp and circumstance surrounding wealthy Roman funerals. These funeral bouts would influence the invention of the Roman gladiator games.</p>
