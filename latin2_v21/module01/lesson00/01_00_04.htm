    <p>You have finished the introduction lesson. This lesson introduced you to your Olympian narrator for
      this moduleâ€”Juno, queen of the Roman pantheon. She will guide you as you move through the rest of
      the module; watch for her important notes and clues to light your way!</p>
    <p>For your next adventure, you will take a pretest with questions on the material for this module to
      see what you already know. Don't worry, this assessment will have very little impact on your overall
      score for the course; however, it will give you a clue about what's to come in this module. It will
      also help you understand how you will be assessed at the end of the module. </p>
