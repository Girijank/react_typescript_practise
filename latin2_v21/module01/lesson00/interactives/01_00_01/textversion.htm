    <h2>Meet Junoâ€”Text Version</h2>

    <p>An illustration of Juno, reclining on a thrown next to two peacocks, with stars in the background and "The Peacock's Complaint" written in the corner. The text of "The Peacock's Complaint" reads: The Peacock considered it wrong that he had not the nightingale's song; So to Juno he went, she replied "Be content with thy having, and hold thy fool's tongue!" Do not quarrel with nature!</p>

      <li>I am often depicted with a staff and crown to indicate my station as queen of the Roman pantheon. Juno is my Roman name. Some of my Roman nicknames are Juno Sospita, Juno Regina, and Juno Curitis. In Greek mythology, I am known as Hera. In Etruscan mythology, I am known as Uni.

        My most reoccurring symbol is the peacock. This colorful bird is a reference to the myth in which I preserved the eyes of the slain giant Argos in the peacock's beautiful tail feathers. This gave the bird its famous, many-eyed appearance.

        My domain was marriage, often with an emphasis on the health and fertility of women. As such, my marriage to the king of the gods, Jupiter, was a large focus of my representation in Roman mythology. Jupiter's realm was the sky, where I am shown here.
