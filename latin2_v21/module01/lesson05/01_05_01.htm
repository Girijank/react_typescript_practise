		<p class="mt-2">Rome's foundation story has been retold by people around the world and across millennia and, as such,
			has become a legend. Despite this mythological and legendary status, it is important to remember
			that the Romans considered this tale a part of their cultural identity and proud heritage.</p>
		<p>But the Romans aren't the only ones with a fantastical foundation story. All around the world,
			ancient and modern civilizations alike celebrate their unique beginnings with tales of fabulous
			founders. You will have an opportunity to research these foundations and see how they compare with
			the wanderings of Aeneas and the first Roman kings. </p>
		<p>First, let's look at an example &mdash; featuring Rome's sometime rival, Carthage.</p>

						<h4>Carthage: A Foundation Story</h4>
						<p>Mythologically founded, 831 BCE</p>

						<hr />
						<p>According to the most prominent foundation story of Carthage:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It was mythologically founded by Dido, the daughter of King Mattan of Tyre in 831 BCE.
								Dido had
								left Tyre after her father died. She sailed to Africa where the Libyan king Hiarbus
								offered her
								a portion of his land. She and her supporters settled in this new land and founded the
								city of
								Carthage.</li>
							<li>Historically, the city of Carthage was founded by Phoenicians as a trading post and may
								have
								been known as Utica. </li>
							<li>Mythological accounts of Dido's marriage differ. According to Vergil, she married
								Aeneas.
								According to Pompeius Trogus, she married a chief priest, Acharbas. Both stories end in
								her
								martyrdom, which established her as a goddess of the city. Many ancient Punic and
								Phoenician
								accounts associate Dido with the goddess Tanit.</li>
						</ul>
