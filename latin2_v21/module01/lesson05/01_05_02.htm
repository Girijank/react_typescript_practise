		<p>You can use this <a href="docs/L2_0105_Workshop_Template.docx" target="_blank">template</a> to complete each part

		<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <br>Review what you learned in previous lessons about the mythological and
			historical foundation of the city of Rome. Then, choose <strong>two</strong> other places with hybrid
			mythological and historical origins, and research their most prominent foundation stories. Complete the
			following chart.</p>
		<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th class="black white-text first-heading-box">&nbsp;</th>
					<th class="black white-text">Rome/ the Romans</th>
					<th class="black white-text">1<sup>st</sup> Comparison:<br /> Place Name/People</th>
					<th class="black white-text">2<sup>nd</sup> Comparison:<br />Place Name/People</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Founder’s Origin: name, date, birthplace, parents, etc. (can be "according to legend/myth")</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Foundation Date and Geological Location</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Foundation Story: mythical elements </td>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>

		<p>Choose <strong>two</strong> places from the list below:</p>

		<ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">
			<li>Persia </li>
			<li>Tenochtitlan</li>
			<li>Egypt</li>
			<li>Syracuse</li>
			<li>Celtic Nations</li>
			<li>Nubia</li>
			<li>India</li>
			<li>Yangtze River Valley</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
			Compare and Contrast Paragraph: Now, in English, compare and contrast <strong>Rome’s foundation story with
				the two places you researched</strong>. Make sure to include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>similarities between Rome’s foundation story and the foundation stories of the two places </li>
			<li>differences between Rome’s foundation story and the foundation stories of the two places </li>
			<li>full sentence answers with a minimum of 200 words</li>
			<li>citation of the sources you used for your research, using MLA format</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="stackedp"><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
			Latin Writing Assignment: Write three sentences in Latin about Rome’s foundation story<strong>. At least two
				of the three sentences must be written in the Passive Voice</strong></p>
		<p>Example: Carthage Foundation Story</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sentence 1: Carthago a Phoenicibus constituebatur. (Carthage was founded by the Phoenicians.)</li>
			<li>Sentence 2: Dido est regina Carthaginis. (Dido is the queen of Carthage.)</li>
			<li>Sentence 3: Dido aut a sacerdote aut ab viro de Troia amabatur. (Dido was loved either by a priest or by
				a man from Troy.)</li>
		</ul>

				<h3>Juno's Note: Composing Passive Sentences in Latin</h3>
				<p>Writing Passive sentences in English versus Latin are two very different processes!
				Visit <a href="../../global/toolbox/content/latin2/module01/010502_passive_sentence.htm" class="modal-pop"
					data-mwidth="90%" data-mheight="90%"><strong>Composing a Passive Sentence in Latin</strong></a> for a step-by-step guide. You can always review
				these steps in your <a href="../../global/toolbox/toolbox_01.htm" target="blank">Toolbox</a>.
				<p>When writing in Latin, one challenge many scholars face is the declining of Roman names. Since
					names are nouns and can be used as such in a sentence, make sure they have the correct case
					endings! You can visit <strong>Latin Name Declining</strong> in your <a href="../../global/toolbox/toolbox_01.htm" target="blank">Toolbox</a> for a refresher.</p>
