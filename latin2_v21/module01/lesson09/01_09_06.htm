				<p>Tarquinius Superbus, the last Roman king, was thrown out of Rome. Afterwards, Rome became a Republic ruled by
					the leading senatorial class. In the new Roman Republic, two men, Collatinus and Brutus, became the leaders of
					the new government. However, Roman patrician families of Etruscan descent (the Larcii, Aquilii, Veturii,
					Tarquitii, and Volumnii) remained in Rome for some time. They tried to assert their aristocratic authority
					onto the Roman <em>populus</em>. </p>
				<p>This led to constant struggles between the conservative class and the <em>populus</em> in Rome. Here’s how:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For the next four centuries, Rome and Etruria were at odds. Etruscans began to take over other city-states
						and neighboring towns called <em>castella</em>. </li>
					<li>The Etruscans sided with the Greeks and Samnites against the Romans in forthcoming battles. Both the
						Etruscans and the Romans wanted dominance over the north&mdash;the source of major trade routes and points
						of commerce. </li>
					<li>The Etruscans continued to be a major influence on Rome’s culture, architecture, politics, and
						technological advancements. </li>
				</ul>

							<ul>
								<li>The move from the single-name system (Romulus) to the double-name system (Julius Caesar) can be
									attributed to the Etruscans whose double naming system was quite different from the Greeks and others
									in antiquity. </li>
								<li>The Roman toga is thought to have been derived from the Etruscan <em><span
											class="glossary">tebenna</span></em> which was decorated with clavi that indicated a person’s
									societal rank. </li>
								<li>The Romans also borrowed the practice of <em><span class="glossary">augury</span></em> from the

							<p class="lead"><strong>Design and Technology:</strong></p>
							<p>Known for their craftsmanship in jewelry, design, architecture, and metallurgy, Etruscans shaped
								architectural style, jewelry design, and battle arms used in Rome. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>The Etruscan funerary band was a necklace with a heavy ball-shaped pendant that the Romans took and
									placed on their children’s necks as <em>bullae</em>&mdash;good luck charms. </li>
								<li>The terracotta decoration on the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was
									designed by the Etruscan sculptor Vulca.</li>
								<li>The great Etruscan bronze work is best exhibited by the 5<sup>th</sup> c BCE bronze she-wolf statue,
									which Rome adopted as the symbol of the Republic. </li>
								<li>The Roman military utilized the Etruscan bronze weapons as the basis for their military arms,
									including the basta, the bronze-tipped spear, which can be seen utilized in Etruria from a terracotta
									slab in 6<sup>th</sup> c BCE in Caere, and possibly even the Roman <em><span

								<li>After the middle of the 7<sup>th</sup> c BCE, oval houses were displaced by rectangular atrium
									structures, which mimicked the insides of Etruscan tombs and wealthy Etruscan houses like that of the
