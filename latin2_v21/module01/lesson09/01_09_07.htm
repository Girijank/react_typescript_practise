                <h4>Nota Bene:</h4>
                <p>The Perfect Tense, Active Voice uses the 3rd Principal Part (aka the perfect
                  stem). This can look different from the rest of the dictionary entry for that verb. Keep a look out
                  for a few of these in this passage.</p>
              </div>
              <h4>Translation Checklist</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Have you identified the tense, voice, person, number, and mood of the verb?</li>
                <li>Have you identified the case, number, and gender for the nouns and adjectives?</li>
                <li>Do your English definitions for each of the words in the Latin translation match the
                  definitions found in the toolbox dictionary?</li>
                <li>Have you double-checked your Latin vs. English word order?
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>HINT</strong>: In Latin, adjectives follow the nouns they modify, genitive nouns follow
                      the nouns they possess, and verbs are typically found at the end of the
                      sentence. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Did you transfer all punctuation from Latin to English?</li>
