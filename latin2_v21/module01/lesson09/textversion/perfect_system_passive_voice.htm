  <h2>Perfect System Passive Voice&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: Let's talk about the Perfect System Passive Voice. </p>
  <p>To form a Latin verb in the perfect Passive system, remember the 4th principal part, the Perfect Passive Participle, or PPP for short. It's the last piece of the Latin verb puzzle. </p>
  <p>[On screen text: PPP puzzle piece appears with "<em>amatus</em>, -<em>a</em>, -<em>um</em>" circled in "amo, amare, amavi, <strong>amatus</strong>, <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-um</strong>".] </p>
  <p>[On screen text: Perfect Passive Participle (PPP) + sum (to be.)] </p>
  <p>The perfect system Passive Voice is formed using the Perfect Passive Participle (PPP) plus a form of the verb "sum." The tense of "sum" changes based on which tense of the perfect Passive system your translation needs. </p>
  <p>[On screen: amatus, -a, -um] The PPP of the verb "to love," amatus,-a,-um, looks like an adjective. </p>
  <p>[On screen: "Puella" is added before "amatus, -a, -um. Then "-a, -um" is removed and "amatus" becomes "amata". The final sentence is "puella amata."] This is because the gender and number of the 4th principal part will agree with the gender and number of the subject in a sentence. </p>
  <p>Let's put the puzzle together, using the verb <strong><em>amatus est</em></strong>, which translates to "has been loved." [On screen text: "amatus est" is circled in the sentence "Canis a puella <strong>amatus est</strong>." Below the sentence "has been loved" appears to translate "amatus est".] </p>
  <p>The present tense of "sum" here means that it is in the perfect tense Passive Voice. </p>
  <p>"<strong>A puella</strong>" is the Ablative of Agent. [On screen text: "a puella" is circled in the sentence "Canis <strong>a puella</strong> amatus est."] It sits in the middle of the Latin sentence but translates at the end in English as "by the girl." [On screen text: </p>
  <p>Below the sentence "by the girl" appears to translate "a puella"] </p>
  <p>Putting it together, we can have "Canis a puella amatus est." The dog is loved by the girl. [On screen text: "Canis a puella amatus est" and "The dog was loved by the girl."] </p>
  <p>These are three tenses formed from the PPP: Perfect Passive, Pluperfect Passive, and Future Perfect Passive. Now that you've put the pieces together in Perfect Passive, you can solve the puzzle of Pluperfect and Future Perfect with a similar strategy. </p>
  <p>Let's use the same sentence: "<em>Canis a puella amatus est.</em>" </p>
  <p>If you change the tense of "est" to the imperfect form&mdash;"<strong>erat</strong>"&mdash;the verb is now in the pluperfect Passive. [On screen: "Canis a puella amatus est." is displayed and then transitions "est" to "erat". "erat" is circled in the new sentence "Canis a puella amatus <strong>erat</strong>."] </p>
  <p>To translate, use "had been". The dog had been loved by the girl. [On screen: "Canis a puella amatus erat." and "The dog had been loved by the girl."] </p>
  <p>If you change the tense of "<strong>est</strong>" to the future form&mdash;"<strong>erit</strong>"&mdash;the verb is now in the future perfect Passive. [On screen text: "Canis a puella amatus est." is displayed and then transitions "est" to "erit". "erit" is circled in the new sentence "Canis a puella amatus <strong>erit</strong>."] To translate, use "will have been." The dog will have been loved by the girl. [On screen: "Canis a puella amatus erit." and "The dog will have been loved by the girl."] </p>
  <p>The perfect system Passive Voice can seem like a puzzle at first. But once you find the missing pieces, it all falls into place. </p>
