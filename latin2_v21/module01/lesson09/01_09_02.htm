        <h4>Tarquinius Superbus, 7<sup>th</sup> King of Rome </h4>
        <p>Tarquin the Proud, the last Etruscan king, built the Cloaca Maxima, the great sewer of Rome. He was named
          <em>Superbus</em> (which means haughty or proud) for his arrogance. His son Sextus had seduced and committed a
          crime against a woman, Lucretia, who was the model wife of the Roman noble Collatinus. When the Romans found
          out about this horrible act, Tarquin the Proud and Sextus were both exiled from Rome. </p>
        <p>After Tarquinius Superbus was thrown out of Rome, the Romans vowed never to have another king rule their
          land. Thus, in 509 BCE, the Roman monarchy came to an end. The next form of government would be known as the
          Roman Republic, a government ruled by the people. </p>
          <p>Rome may have had dictators and emperors as leaders. But never again would there be a king. </p>
