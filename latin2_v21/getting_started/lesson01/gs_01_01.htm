			<div class="panel">
				<p>This course will develop fundamental skills needed to master Latin 2. In this course, you will continue your Latin journey through the study of new Latin vocabulary and grammar, viewed through the lens of Roman history and culture. Through listening and reading comprehension, as well as speaking and writing application, you will build on your knowledge of Latin to become a true classical scholar.</p>
			</div>
			<a class="tab" title="header title inside content area">Linguistic Gender</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Throughout the course, you will see nouns and other parts of speech with gender labels. It is important to note that these are <strong>linguistic</strong> genders.</p>
				<p>Linguistic gender isn't the same as social or biological gender. Think of linguistic gender as a purely grammatical way to divide nouns into different groups for categorization. Gender categories change from language to language.</p>
				<p>For example, the gender category for the word "table" varies in different languages. It is linguistically feminine in Spanish (<em>la mesa</em>), Latin (<em>mensa</em>), and French (<em>la table)</em>. In Hebrew, "table" (<em>שולחן</em>) is masculine. In English, "table" is neither feminine nor masculine.</p>
				<p>This is an important topic to keep in mind as you navigate through the course. Not sure what linguistic gender a word follows? Pro-tip: Memorize the gender labels when a word is first introduced.</p>

			<a class="tab" title="header title inside content area">Spoken Latin and Dialect</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Latin is a language, and like any language, there may be variations in how words are spoken. There are many great scholarly debates in the Classics world as to how Latin should sound when spoken. Since it the language of an ancient civilization, Rome, even the most highly regarded pronunciation guides are not agreed upon by all. In this course, we use Classical Latin pronunciation, as it is the most academically accepted guide to the way the Romans spoke.</p>
			</div>
			<a class="tab" title="header title inside content area">Simply Speak Tool and Pronunciation</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Since differences in pronunciation exist, even the Simply Speak tool in this course won't always accurately evaluate the way Latin words are pronounced. Don't despair! Listen to the recordings provided, and play back your pronunciation as recorded by the speech tool. If your pronunciation matches, you are speaking Classical Latin!</p>
