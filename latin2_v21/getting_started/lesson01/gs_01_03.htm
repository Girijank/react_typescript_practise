		<h3 class="mt-3">Lessons & Assessments: Submitting Your Work</h3>
		<p><strong>As you complete each lesson, you will need to submit an assessment. The type of assessment varies
				for each lesson. Here are some assessment types you will see in this course.</strong> </p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8">
				<h3>Pretest</h3>
				<p>At the beginning of each lesson, you will take a pretest of multiple-choice questions related to the
					content in the module to see what you already know. Don't worry; this diagnostic will have little to
					no impact on your grade, but it will give you a window into the knowledge you will gain throughout
					the module. It will also help you understand one component of how you will be assessed in the
					course.</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Quizzes</h3>
				<p>Many lessons include a multiple-choice quiz with questions. In these types of assessments, you will choose
					one correct answer from the choices given. Often the question is paired with an image or data graph. To be
					successful, make sure to read each question and its stimuli carefully, and use your skills to select the
					best response.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Module Exams</h3>
				<p>Each module will end with a multiple-choice and matching exam that assesses your understanding. Module exams
					also contain questions to test your listening comprehension of Latin, so be sure to have speakers or
					headphones to hear the audio files.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Discussion-Based Assessments</h3>
				<p>The Discussion-Based Assessment (or DBA) is an opportunity to discuss your skills and learning objectives in
					each module with your instructor. This isn't a "one size fits all" activity. Each DBA is a specific activity
					and discussion. It provides opportunities for you to make connections in your own learning across key
					concepts, ideas, and policies. You can ask questions and demonstrate your growing skills.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Translations</h3>
				<p>Translations are teacher-graded assignments that allow you to demonstrate your Latin translating skills. For
					these assignments, you will translate a selection of Latin sentences into your own words in English and
					answer grammar and comprehension questions based on your translations.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Workshops</h3>
				<p>Workshops are an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned. To be successful, read all of the
					instructions and the rubric to see how you will be graded. All workshops will include a Latin composition
					element. Workshops often involve multiple elements, so don't forget to save your work often. Templates are
					also provided to ensure you have everything you need to complete the workshop project.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Segment Exam</h3>
				<p>The segment exam at the end of the course will assess your understanding of the course as a whole. It will
					include multiple-choice and matching questions. Like the module exams, these segment exams will include an
					audio component as well.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h3>Collaboration</h3>
				<p>Collaboration assessments are peer project opportunities. You will have the opportunity to participate in a
					complex, multi-step, problem-solving activity and share feedback with at least one other student to benefit
					from a peer's perspective. There are synchronous and asynchronous opportunities, meaning you do not have to
					be working with your peers at the exact same time, but you may. However, you must complete the collaboration
					assessment before taking the segment exam. There are opportunities provided in the collaboration section.
					Contact your instructor early about collaboration opportunities. </p>
