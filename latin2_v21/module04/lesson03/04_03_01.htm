    <h1>Rise Up, Spartacus!</h1>

    <p>You might have heard of him —<strong> Spartacus!</strong> He has been represented in many different forms of
      modern media, from novel to movie to television drama. According to legend, Spartacus was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a Roman allied soldier from Thrace, who escaped his legion, was captured by the Romans, and then enslaved as his punishment</li>
      <li>sent to Capua to train as a gladiator where in 73 BCE, he and Crixus, a Gaul, would organize a group of gladiatorial slaves and escape their training grounds</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Spartacus and his followers traveled to Vesuvius, picking up fellow supporters of other runaway slaves,
          farmers, or free workers along the way. <strong> Their goal <em><span
