				<p> <em>A medal, a new car, money? No! A Grass Crown! </em> This was what a Roman general wanted the
					most after his victory! Can you believe it! The Grass Crown (<em>Corona graminea</em>/<em>Corona
						obsidionalis</em>) was the highest award a Roman general could receive for his military service during the
					Republic. It was awarded to a leader who had saved an entire legion of an army.</p>

				<h4 class="mt-2">What was it made of? </h4>
				<p>The crown was made out of wildflowers, grass, and wheat from the land on which the commander saved his army.
				</p>

				<h4 class="mt-2">Who presented it? </h4>
				<p>It was presented to a commander by his soldiers. It could also be presented by the Senate and the Roman
					people to an outstanding commander. </p>

				<p>Pliny the Elder describes the Grass Crown in Book XXII of his <em>Naturalis Historia</em> as a crown of the
					highest honor, only awarded to a most exceptional commander to honor his bravery in times of extreme
					desperation. The crown was so revered because it was given to a commander on the spot of a battle.
					His soldiers would gather up grass from the ground and present the crown to him. </p>
