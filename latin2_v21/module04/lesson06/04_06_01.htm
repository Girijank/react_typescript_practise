        <p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion Based Assessment&mdash;DBA</strong>. </p>
        <p>Now you know about the conflicts Rome had—with itself and others—while it attempted to expand its borders during the time of the Republic. You should now be familiar with how to form and translate comparative and superlative adjectives, including using <em>quam</em> with either, as well as adverbs in the comparative and superlative degrees. </p>
        <p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss these topics with your instructor. Talking about (and in) a foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to practice on your own before your discussion assessment—the more you speak, the more at ease you will feel. Time to dust off this "ancient" language and give it a whirl! </p>
        <p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact your teacher.</p>
