    <p>146 BCE was a turning point for Roman expansion mentality.  Rome had now suppressed Carthage and Corinth and possessed parts of Africa, Macedonia, Greece, and Corinth as provinces.  Rome set out to occupy more territories. Here’s what Rome did:</p>
    <ul>
<li>It entered into wars with the Numidians, a powerful African tribe run under the leadership of the mighty Jugurtha, grandson of Masinissa, the same king who helped Scipio Africanus in the Second Punic War and Scipio Aemilianus in the Third Punic War.  </li>
<li>Rome engaged in the Social Wars. These were wars between the different allied <em><span class="glossary">(socii)</span></em> tribes of Italy. </li>
<li>It also engaged in the Mithridatic Wars. These were wars against the ruthless King Mithridates VI of Pontus.</li>
    </ul>
