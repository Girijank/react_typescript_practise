        Did I mention that I love war? I don’t make excuses for my lust of
        war. <em><span class="glossary">Mecum galeam meam, scutum meum, gladium meum, et hastam meam porto—proelium paro!</span></em>
        My fellow Olympians call me all sorts of nasty names, like
        “blood-luster, butcher, fury, liar, maniac,” but I think it’s because
        they are jealous of my strength and love for war! I can’t help who I
        am. And even though I pledged no allegiance to either side during the
        Trojan War, when the Trojans needed my help, I stormed down, against
        my father’s commands, to fight alongside Hector against the Greeks. I
        was unyielding—tearing through the Greek ranks, one by one—Orestes,
        Trekos, Helenos, Periphas, to name a few.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mom, Juno, was furious that I had killed so many of her beloved
        Greeks. <em>Mom, you should be on my side! </em>I couldn’t be stopped,
        until my father, Jupiter, gave my mom, Juno, permission to slow my
        gait. I was turning towards the Greek hero Diomedes, who had wounded
        Venus earlier, when Juno sent Minerva down to help Diomedes fight me.
        Together, they stabbed me in my belly. I let out a cry as loud as 9000
        or 10,000 men, it hurt so badly!
        <em><span class="glossary">Ita, et in corpore et in animo vulneror.</span></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I needed the comfort of my father after that and immediately went back
        to Mt. Olympus where my father, Jupiter, scolded me and told me how
        ashamed he was of my weak demeanor. He called me a double-faced liar
        and refused to look at me! <em>Dad, you’re just like Mom! </em>Well,
        I’ll bounce back, have the doctor Paieon put medicines on my wound,
        and before you know it, I’ll be back on the battlefield fighting in
        another war!
