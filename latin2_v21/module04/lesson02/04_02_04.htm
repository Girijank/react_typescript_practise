                <p>
                  Jugurtha was a fearless leader. At first, he was beloved by
                  the Romans, respected by the Numidians, and then later
                  feared by his family, countrymen, and the Roman state.

                <p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    He was the grandson of Massinissa, who had helped Scipio
                    Africanus in the Second Punic War.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    His uncle, Micipsa, who had become the Numidian leader,
                    had left one-third of the Numidian kingdom to Jugurtha and
                    the other two-thirds to Jugurtha’s cousins.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He wanted the entire Numidian kingdom for himself, so he
                    killed his cousin Hiempsal, which pushed Numidia into a
                    civil war.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He pursued his other cousin Adherbal, who had asked Rome
                    for help against Jugurtha. The Romans sent Sulla, Marius,
                    the consul Metellus, and Italian elite soldiers to rout
                    out Jugurtha.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Jugurtha killed Adherbal and Roman soldiers in the town of
                    Cirta.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He was betrayed by his son-in-law, Bocchus, who turned him
                    over to Rome where he was executed.

                <p>
                  Italian allies had fought on behalf of Rome and alongside
                  Rome for centuries now, and always with the promise of being
                  granted Roman citizenship.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The allies had had enough! Rome had no intention of
                    granting them citizenship.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The allies rose up in rebellion against Rome in 91 BCE.
                    Caught by surprise, Rome lost the early battles and
                    therefore granted citizenship to the allies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rome struck back with all its might! With seasoned leaders
                    such as Marius and Sulla, Rome subdued the rebellion, and
                    the allies folded in 87 BCE.

                    He wanted absolute power, so after his father’s death, he
                    assassinated his mother and brother.

                  <li>
                    He went on a conquering spree all over the northern coast
                    of the Black Sea, Anatolia, and into Italian territory to
                    help the allies in the Social War.

                  <li>
                    He then set out to assassinate all Romans and Italians
                    living in the province of Asia. Rome struck back and went
                    into a series of three wars against Mithridates from 87
                    BCE&ndash;63 BCE.

              Have you heard of the term Mithridatic poisoning? Mithridates VI
              was so fearful he would be poisoned by someone that he
              would ingest small doses of poison (in a chewing tablet form) on
              a regular basis, with the hopes of creating immunity from
              poison. Supposedly, the concoction contained small amounts of
              arsenic and venom.
            </p>

              <strong>Why do you think this story about Mithridates has become part
                of modern folklore?
