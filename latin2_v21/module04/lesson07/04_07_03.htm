		<h1>The First Civil War: 88 BCE&ndash;31 BCE</h1>
		

		<p>Now that you know who started the First Civil War, let’s learn more about the war itself! As you read, think
			about whose side you are on and why. Then think about the comparisons between the Roman Civil War and the
			American Civil War.</p>

				<p>I, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, am on Marius’s side, even though it might not have seemed like it at first. Sulla had first supported me for consulship in 87 BCE, only because he wanted to use me as a
					pawn against Marius. But I always supported the agenda of a “novus homo,” <em><span class="glossary">quod in
							periculum me posuit.</span></em> I abhorred Sulla’s “marching on
					Rome.” Well, the Senate then stripped me of my consulship and my Roman citizenship, and so I went
					into exile. I teamed up with Marius when he was in self-exile in Africa. We formed an army and
					conducted our own “March on Rome”!</p>

					Marius and Cinna march on Rome. Marching on Rome is an outright disgrace and an act of war! Marius
					and Cinna defeated Sulla and together became co-consuls in 86 BCE. But Marius would die only a
					couple weeks later, and thus poor Cinna could not stand up to Sulla’s men who were still in Rome.
