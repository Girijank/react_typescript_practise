        <p>Rome had conquered so many lands, that now it wanted to conquer itself! I know this sounds outrageous, but
          Romans turned on Romans and waged a series of civil wars in Rome.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>The Civil Wars</strong>: In the 1st c. BCE, Rome waged three wars upon its own soil. Driven by the egos
      and personalities of Rome’s most powerful men, the war exposed flaws in Rome’s political systems and laws. For a
      period of sixty years, the infighting between Roman consuls  questors, senators, armies, and other leadership brought great damage to the physical, political, and psychological structure of the city, and eventually <strong>three civil wars would bring the Roman Republic to its collapse</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Setting the Stage </h3>
    <p>The key to understanding the civil wars is understanding the personalities and actions of the leaders of each
      war.</p>
    <p><strong>Marius vs. Sulla</strong>: Their hatred towards one another was epic. Marius was beloved by the people
      and the Roman army, and Sulla was admired by the Roman elite. Both were very ambitious men. Sulla had served under
      Marius’s command in the Jugurthine and Social Wars, but he always tried to outdo Marius. Sulla claimed credit for
      Jugurtha’s surrender in the Jugurthine War, which angered Marius who was its Roman commander. Their animosity
      toward one another led to the two men gathering their own troops to fight one another in the streets of Rome,
      causing the <strong>First Civil War</strong>! </p>

          <p>I am Cornelius Sulla, born in 138 BCE into a patrician family and beloved by
            the Roman elite. I am politically and militaristically ambitious. I believe that I led the Romans to victory
            against Jugurtha. My first consulship was in 88 BCE. I was granted dictatorship until 80 BCE. <span
              class="glossary">Non Gaium Marium amo!</span> And as a result, I decided to fight against Marius in our
            own city of Rome. So, the Roman people gave me permission to be the first person to ever cross Rome’s
            <em><span class="glossary">pomerium</span></em> and march on Rome, declaring war! Come get me, Marius!</p>

          <p>Oh Sulla, forever changing the narrative of what actually
            happened.<strong> This is why I do not like you</strong>. First, you claim that you come from a patrician
            family. Must I remind you that your family was insignificant, and you are only rich because your stepmom
            and mistress left money to you. I never thought you would go so far though as to actually cross the
            pomerium with your men and declare war against me and on the Roman people. For what? Power for the Senate?
            Unreal! Remember that I am Marius, the “third founder of Rome,” the champion of the military, the one who
            held six consulships.<span class="glossary">Frangam te, Sulla!</span></p>

        <h3>Mars' Missive: Sulla receives the Grass Crown!</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sulla received the Grass Crown in 89 BCE, after he had killed 20,000 Marusian men at the city of Nola
            during the Social War. </li>
          <li>This was the first time Sulla had won a major battle without the help of another leader. </li>
          <li>This private award would have meant a great deal to Sulla at this time, for it meant that his troops
            deemed him an exceptional leader. It also meant that Sulla could trust his troops and that they would remain
            loyal to him thereafter. </li>
