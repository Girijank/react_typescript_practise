					<tr>
						<td><strong>Step 1:</strong> Did you fill out the war story chart provided? Did you name the conflict/event you were in from ancient Rome?</td>
						<td>Remember:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>You will use the chart to write your narrative. </li>
								<li>You will select a war from the list provided. Review previous lessons for historical information. Also, conduct your own outside research on the war. </li>
								<li>You can select a character from the list provided in the war story chart. Or you can create a character role of your own.</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Step 2:</strong> Did you write a narrative that contains at least 250 words?</td>
						<td>Remember:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>Use the war story chart you filled out previously to help guide the information you cover in your story. </li>
								<li>Make sure you have conducted your own research. Your information must be in complete English sentences. </li>
								<li>Provide a title for your story.</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Step 3:</strong> Write three sentences in Latin, and infuse them into your narrative.</td>
						<td>Remember:<br>
							You will be writing three sentences in Latin.
							<ul>
								<li>One must contain a comparative adjective.</li>
								<li>One must contain a <strong>superlative adjective</strong>. </li>
								<li>One must contain <strong>either a comparative or superlative adverb</strong>.</li>
							</ul>
							Your sentences should be simple and short, reflecting your level of Latin proficiency. Provide English translations with these Latin sentences below your story narrative.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2"> &#x27A4; <strong>Latin sentence 1:</strong></p>
							<p>“Miles, nobis cum <strong>fortissime</strong> pugna et veni!” = superlative adverb
								</p>
						</td>
						<td class="mt-1">Remember:
							<p class="mb-1">To form the comparative or superlative adverb according to its grammar rules:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The comparison of adverbs is the comparative neuter singular form of its comparative adjective form.</li>
								<li>The superlative of adverbs uses the base of the superlative adjective form + -e</li>
							</ul>

						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2"> &#x27A4; <strong>Latin sentence 2:</strong></p>
							<p>Etiam, <strong>ferociores</strong> peditus, equitatus, velites, et hastates Romanos video. 

								</p>
						</td>
						<td class="mt-1">Remember:
							<p>To decline a comparative adjective according to your declining rules:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The comparative is formed by adding - <em>ior</em> (m. and f.), - <em>ius</em> (n.) to the stem/base of the positive (feminine nominative singular minus the ending). </li>
							</ul>
							You can use grammar constructs such as the “Ablative of Comparison” and “quam+ comparative” in your sentence formation.

						<td class="mt-1">Remember:<br>
							To decline a superlative adjective according to your declining rules:
							<ul>
								<li>The superlative is formed by adding  <em>-issimus,-a, -um</em>or <em>-rrimus,-a,-um</em> or <em>-llimus,-a,-um</em> to the base of the positive.</li>
