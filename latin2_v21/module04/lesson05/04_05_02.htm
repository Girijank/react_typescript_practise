		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> </p>
		<p>Review what you learned in previous lessons about the wars that Rome fought. Then, choose one war and conduct
			additional research on it. Complete the following war story chart.</p>
		<p><strong>Choose a war from the list below:</strong></p>
		<ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">
			<li>Etruscan Wars</li>
			<li>Latin Wars</li>
			<li>Punic Wars</li>
			<li>Jugurthine War</li>
			<li>Social Wars</li>
			<li>Mithridatic Wars</li>
			<li>The War of Spartacus</li>
		</ul>

						<p>-general</p>
						<p>-legate</p>
						<p>-leader</p>

		<p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2: </strong></p>
			<p>Write your war story narrative. Utilize your research within previous lessons and the research you conducted
				on your own. You can use the sample war story, “<strong>My Disastrous Time in the Samnite War</strong>” as a
				creative guide. Be sure to include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tell a narrative story in English, in a minimum of 250 words, using the details from your research chart
					(see step 1).</li>
				<li>Use three sentences written in Latin, embedded into your story. See step 3, below, for Latin sentence
					specific guidelines. </li>
				<li>Give a citation of the sources you used for your research, using MLA format .</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> </p>
			<p> <strong>Latin Writing Assignment</strong>: Supply the three sentences in Latin from your narrative, along
				with their English translations.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>One sentence must contain a comparative adjective.</li>
				<li>One sentence must contain a superlative adjective.</li>
				<li>One sentence must contain either a comparative or superlative adverb.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Example: “<strong>My Disastrous Time in the Samnite War</strong>”</p>
			<p>Sentence 1: “Miles, nobis cum <strong>fortissime</strong> pugna et veni!” = superlative adverb</p>
			<p>Sentence 2: Etiam, <strong>ferociores</strong> peditus, equitatus, velites, et hastates Romanos video. = comparative adjective</p>
			<p>Sentence 3: Id erat <strong>crudellimum!</strong> = superlative adjective</p>

					<h3>Mars' Missive: Composing with Comparatives and Superlatives in Latin</h3>
					<p>Writing sentences in English versus Latin are two very different processes! Visit Composing using Comparatives and Superlatives in Latin in your <a href="../../global/toolbox/toolbox_01.htm" target="blank">Toolbox</a> for a step-by-step guide.</p>
					<p>When writing in Latin, one challenge many scholars face is the declining of Roman names. Since names are
						nouns and can be used as such in a sentence, make sure they have the correct case endings! You can visit
