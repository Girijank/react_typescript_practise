		<h1>A Roman Soldier's Story</h1>

			about fighting in so many wars? </p>

			time to the age of the Roman Republic. We’ve plopped you down ontothe battlefield of one of Rome’s wars. You’re a
			soldier now! So, it's time for you to tell your story.</p>

						<p class="lead">My Disastrous Time in the Samnite War</p>
						<hr />
						<p>My goodness, I have landed in the city of Caudium in southern Italy and from the looks of it, I’m in the
							middle of the Samnite War in 321 BCE! Those men over there dressed in mismatched uniforms, carrying
							daggers and wearing bronze shields, are Roman soldiers, I believe. Yes, they must be, because I see them
							launching stones of fire from an onager towards those men over yonder dressed in sparkling armor and
							wearing decorative bracelets and jewelry. I also see two deep, narrow passes with a watered grassy plain
							in between a mountain chain. I think I read about this in book nine of <em>Livy’s ab Urbe Condita</em>. I’m in the
							midst of the battle at the Caudine Forks between the Romans and the Samnites! </p>
						<p> The Romans are calling me over <em>Miles, nobiscum fortissime pugna et veni!” </em>Somehow, I understand
							their Latin! I grab a gladius and begin attacking the Samnites. I recognize my Roman leaders, the consuls
							Spurius Posthumius Albinus and T. Veturius Calvinusas, fighting alongside me. <em>Etiam, ferociores
								peditus, equitatus, velites, et hastates Romanos video.</em> I also see that the Samnites are more
							comfortable with this hilly terrain than we are. We are losing! </p>
						<p>I can’t keep up. I have become entrapped within the Caudine Forks, and the Samnites have us surrounded. I
							hear their leader, Herennius, say that he wants to kill all of us! Luckily, Herrenius’s son, Pontius,
							offered us an alternative to death. He allowed us to walk under the yoke of the Caudine Forks as a
							surrender to the Samnite army. But we had to remove our clothing, our paludamenta, and lay down our arms
							when we did it. <em>Id erat crudellimum! </em> I thought fighting for Rome would be glorious, but not if
							I’m in one of the few battles in which Rome was embarrassingly defeated! Please return me back home!</p>

		<p>Your mission…to research one of the wars Rome fought in the Roman Republic and write your war story, detailing
			your experience in it. What is your role and how do you behave in the war? It’s your war story, so you could be as
			creative as possible. Provide descriptions of the battle, players, fighting gear, and anything that you or your
			opponent is doing which provides great imagery for your story. Just remember, you’re fighting for Rome in an
			actual war that took place, so do your research on the war, and read back over your previous lessons to inspire
			your writing!</p>
