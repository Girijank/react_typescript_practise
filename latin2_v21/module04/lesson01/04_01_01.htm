		<p class="mt-5">In this module, you will discover how Rome continued to grow in size and might, even when
			challenged by outside opponents or by its own people. Very similar to my own abilities, Rome always
			persisted, its people remained resolute, and its promise remained <em><span class="glossary">indefatigable</span></em>.</p> 
		<p>Let’s learn more about how I think and what shaped my own fierce mentality so that you can understand why I
			see greatness for the future of Rome!</p>
