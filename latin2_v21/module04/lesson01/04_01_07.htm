    <h1>Army Divisions</h1>

    <p>The army contained four main divisions: <strong>legionaries, auxiliaries, allied soldiers,</strong> and
      <strong>mercenaries</strong>. Let’s learn about these ranks and unit divisions</p>

            <p>The Roman auxilia were essential aids to the Roman army. In fact, because only about 10% of the army’s population were actually Roman citizens, Rome needed non-Roman citizens to aid its legions. The Roman
              auxilia were non-Roman citizens who fought in the front lines and hailed from all over Roman provinces and
              territories. They were deployed as specialist units&mdash;archers, slingers, spear-throwers, or whatever the
              fighting style of their native land was. They were normally stationed in their native land to ward off any
              uprisings in Roman territories. This was a psychological methodology the Romans applied to its allied
              troops to control its far-reaching army. The auxiliaries were </p>
