    <h1>The Second Civil War: <em>Veni, Vidi, Vici! </em> </h1>
    <p><em>Caesar crossed the Rubicon</em> is probably one of the most well-known phrases from classical studies. Let’s
      learn about why he crossed the Rubicon River and how the crossing helped Caesar become Rome’s most powerful, but
      feared leader.</p>

        <p><strong><em><span class="glossary">Alea Iacta Est!</span></em></strong></p>
        <p>Caesar had successfully fought a series of wars against the Gauls between 58 BCE and 52 BCE. He wrote a
          first-hand account of these wars in his work titled, <span class="glossary">“De bello Gallico.”</span> After
          securing most of Gaul for Rome in 50 BCE, Caesar was expecting a <em><span class="glossary">Triumph</span></em>
          from the Roman Senate. However, the Senate now feared Caesar’s
          ever-growing popularity and power and thus denied him a <em>Triumph</em>.They also denied his candidature
          request for consul. Caesar’s ego had been bruised, so he gathered 40,000 of his soldiers, left his post in
          Gaul, and crossed the Rubicon River in Italy, which garnered a similar meaning to when Sulla
          <em>Marched on Rome</em>. In 49 BCE, by <em>Crossing the Rubicon,</em> Caesar had declared war on Rome, but
          most
          specifically, on the Senate. This was the beginning of the <strong>Second Civil War</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Caesar versus Pompey</strong></p>
        <p>Pompey, who controlled the Senate in which there were a vast majority of men hostile towards
          Caesar, waged battles against Caesar on behalf of the Republic. Pompey was a statesman and part of the old
          Republican guard which sought to maintain a level of <em><span class="glossary">dignitas</span></em> within
          the Senate. He and the Senate thought Caesar’s <em>Crossing of the Rubicon</em> was an insult on this
          <em>dignitas</em>. Here’s how their bouts unfolded: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pompey first headed to Greece to gather forces. Knowing that Pompey had allied support in Spain, Caesar
            went to Spain to neutralize Pompey’s troops there. </li>
          <li>Then, Pompey and Caesar and their armies faced off in Greece. Pompey had a far superior army and
            believed he could win against Caesar. </li>
          <li>In 48 BCE, their two armies fought on the Grecian coastal city of Thessaly. Caesar’s veteran army won, and
            Pompey escaped to Egypt where he was murdered by its king. </li>
          <li>Caesar, not knowing of Pompey’s death, sailed to Egypt where he was supported by the Egyptian queen,
            Cleopatra. He then returned the favor to Cleopatra by fighting wars in Egypt for her to help her secure
            her throne. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><em><span class="glossary">Veni, Vidi, Vici!</span></em></strong></p>
        <p>On his way home from Egypt,Caesar said <strong>these famous words</strong> after waging a minor battle
          against King Pharnacesin Pontus. On his way back to Rome from Egypt, Julius Caesar fought small battles along
          the way, including defeating King Pharnaces in the city of Pontus, which you might remember was once ruled
          by King Mithridates VI. </p>
        <p>Caesar definitely <strong>came, saw, and conquered</strong>! He conquered the Gauls, Rome, Pompey, and
          Anatolia and returned home to Rome in 46 BCE, victorious. He was then given the title of <em>Dictator</em>
          and squashed any opposition to his power. He killed Pompey’s son, defeated Spain and made it a province, and
          finally celebrated that <em>Triumph</em> he had always wanted in 45 BCE. The <strong>Second Civil
            War</strong> was now over.</p>
