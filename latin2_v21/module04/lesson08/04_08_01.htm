		<p>Have you ever heard of the <em>power of three</em>? Well, the Romans surely did. In 60 BCE, three dynamic
			Roman leaders, Julius Caesar, Marcus Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompey, formed an alliance to help their political ambitions in Rome. This alliance was known as the <strong>First <em><span class="glossary">Triumvirate</span></em></strong>.</p>
		<p>The three were equally dependent on each other to advance their power, but each one sought glory for personal
			reasons. Why? </p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Crassus</strong>, the richest of the three, was the Roman commander who had defeated Spartacus
				and his slave revolt&mdash;even though Pompey, one of Crassus’ lieutenants, had taken much of the credit, and
				rightfully so. Thus, Crassus was searching for glory and redemption. </li>
			<li>
				<strong>Pompey “the Great”</strong> was the leading man in the Republic and had success in wiping out
				pirates in Asia and reorganizing the continent as a Roman province. But when he came back to Rome, he
				wanted the Senate to give his men free land for their accomplishments. They did not.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Julius Caesar</strong>, the rising star, was drowning in debt, and after his victorious campaign
				in Spain, he wanted the Senate to give him a Triumph as well as permission to run for office. They did
				not.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="mt-2">Pompey and Caesar were more successful than Caesar. However, they recognized that Caesar was a growing star, and thus, they all joined together so that they could use one another to push through to legislature their own personal desires. The agreement was formed so that “no political action be taken which did not suit any one of the three.” So, they pooled their resources and strategized together to help each other accomplish their political goals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Caesar married off his daughter, Julia, to Pompey to reinforce their alliance for future benefits.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pompey was given his land, and Caesar was given the governorship of Gaul. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The three of them were able to get Caesar elected as co&dash;consul in 59 BCE. As a result of their combined effort, the <strong>First Triumvirate</strong> became the most powerful political alliance in Rome!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<p>The Triumvirate was also formed out of mutual suspicion of one another, which would later be the cause of its undoing and the cause of the <strong>Second Civil War</strong>. The first cracks in the bond surfaced when Julia died in 54 BCE, and Pompey refused to marry another one of Caesar’s relatives. Instead, he married the daughter of Metellus Scipio, who was one of Caesar’s enemies. Then, when Crassus died in 53 BCE, Pompey and Caesar’s alliance was on thin ice.</p>
