				<p><em>If everyone thinks I am too powerful, then let me tell you my own story...</em>
					I won a great victory against the Gauls in the Gallic Wars. Yes, I should have been granted a
					Triumph for this. Upon my return to Rome, I immediately set out to enact major reforms for my
					beloved Roman people. I offered land to my military veterans as I had promised them in the Gallic
					Wars. I looked over the urban poor and gave grain to them, and also, I sent them to live happily on
					our Roman colonies of North Africa, Greece, and Anatolia. I consulted the best astronomers and
					mathematicians to create a new calendar that would calculate the days of the year much better than
					what we had. I limited the number of terms a governor could hold because I believe that no one should have that much power.<em><span class="glossary">Etiam numerum virorum in Senatu auxi.</span></em></p>

					<p>All of my reforms should have pleased everyone. I even increased the number of jobs in the city,
						built a public library, cleaned up the dirt and grime in our city. I was doing what was best
						for the <em>populus Romanus</em>. In 44 BCE, I appointed myself
						<em><span class="glossary">dictator perpetuo.</span></em> Some say that I now thought of myself
						as <em>Rex Romae</em>. But remember when Mark Antony tried to crown me with a laurel wreath in
						the Lupercalia festival? I pushed him away and said only Jupiter could wear a crown of that
						esteem. It was my fellow Senators who named me <em>Imperator </em> of the next ten
						years, who crafted an ivory statue of me, who renamed the month of Quinctilus as July in my
						honor! Who could possibly say that the people didn’t love me, Julius Caesar!</p>
