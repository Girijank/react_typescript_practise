		<h1>The Second Triumvirate</h1>

		<p>Mark Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian, three ambitious and powerful men who did not care for one another, joined
			forces in 43 BCE as <strong>The Second Triumvirate</strong> for the purpose of avenging Caesar’s death and
			restoring the Republic.</p>

		<p>Mark Antony was a military leader who had served under Caesar in Italy, Spain, and at the battle of Pharsalus. Caesar had bequeathed to him his papers and treasury. Lepidus had been a huge supporter of Caesar, even helping Caesar to fight Pompey in Spain and to become dictator in Rome. Octavian was the great-nephew and the adopted nineteen-year-old son of Julius Caesar.</p>

								The Second Triumvirate’s first order of business was to track down the conspirators who killed Caesar.
								Antony and Octavian were able to defeat Brutus and Cassius in Greece. Antony continued east to raise
								money for troops and track down other conspirators. A series of events followed:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Octavian went back to Italy to give land to Caesar’s veterans.</li>
								<li>Lepidus remained in Rome to watch over the Republic.</li>
								<li>Antony and Octavian consistently had problems in their relationship. However, Antony married Octavian’s sister, Octavia, in hopes of solidifying their bond.</li>
								<li>Then Lepidus, who had helped Antony win a battle in Sicily, took credit for a win in Greece. Antony,
									enraged by this, deposed him from his power and removed him from the Triumvirate. </li>

							<h4>Third Civil War</h4>
							<p>
								With Lepidus out of the picture, Mark Antony now controlled the east and Octavian, the west. <strong>The
									fight for power was on</strong>!
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Antony had an affair with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra in hopes of her supplying money to his war
									efforts. </li>
								<li>Octavian was furious with Antony’s bold abandonment of Octavia. </li>
								<li>The <em>Senatuset populus Romanus</em> took the side of Octavian.</li>
								<li> Octavian, who had been preparing for a battle against Antony for three years, used this outrage as
									his breaking point for starting a war against Antony.</li>
								<li><strong>In 32 BCE, the Third Civil War had begun. </strong></li>

							<p>Octavian and Antony met at Actium in Greece. Octavian and his naval commander, Agrippa, blockaded many of the seaports from entry for Antony. Octavian amassed around 400 ships and had the support of Cleopatra’s legionnaires. Agrippa’s navy was able to keep the enemy ships at bay until Cleopatra made a mistake; she made the command to lead the ships in between Octavian’s battleline.</p>
							<p>Antony’s ships got stuck and were destroyed. Only Cleopatra’s ship escaped. </p>
							<p>Antony and Cleopatra fled back to Egypt, and his troops surrendered to Octavian. Nearly a year later,
								Antony and Cleopatra died by their own hands, and Egypt became a province of Rome. The Second
								Triumvirate was over, and the <strong>Third Civil War</strong> had ended.</p>
