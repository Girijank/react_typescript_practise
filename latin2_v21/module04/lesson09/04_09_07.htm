				<h4>The Battle of Actium</h4>
				<p>The Second Triumvirate started to break apart as tensions developed between Mark Antony and Octavius.  Mark Antony divorced his second wife to pursue an affair with the Egyptian princess Cleopatra.  Many Romans thought this was unbecoming of a Roman leader.  It should also be remembered that Octavius was considered Julius Caesar’s only heir, which gave him considerable political clout.  Like politicians in all ages, the two rivals vied for power over the Roman Republic.  War broke out, and the decisive battle was fought at Actium off the coast of Greece on September 2nd, 31 BCE.  The battle in the Ionian Sea was a turning point in the history of Rome.  Octavius won control, and the Republic eventually became the Empire. </p>
				<p>Read and translate the passage below to learn more about the battle. You will submit your translation of this passage and answers to the following questions to your instructor. Make sure to use the vocabulary aid for help with tricky vocabulary!</p>
