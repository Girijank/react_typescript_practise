    <ul>
      <li>As the god of war, my most prominent symbols are my plumed helmet and weapon, often a sword, but some images show me with a spear. My demeaner is always fierce! In Rome, I am Mars, but in Greek mythology, I am known as Ares. In Etruscan mythology, I am known as Laran. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Ever ready for battle, I am usually depicted wearing armor and carrying a shield. I strike an imposing figure in my regalia!
      </li>
      <li>
        As you might expect, I can usually be found among my soldiers on the battlefield. Much of my mythology portrays me at war, though I have been known to carry on a little political and personal intrigue amongst the other deities of Rome.
