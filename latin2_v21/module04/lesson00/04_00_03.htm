This lesson introduced you to Mars, your Olympian narrator for this module, as the Roman god of war and military pursuit. He will guide you as you move through the rest of the module; watch for his important missives&mdash;his orders come with useful training tips!</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">For your next adventure, you will take a pretest with questions on the material for this module to see what you already know. Don't worry&mdash;this assessment will have very little impact on your overall score for the course; however, it will give you a clue about what's to come in this module. It will also help you understand how you will be assessed at the end of the module.</p>
