     <p>The Romans used their mythological stories of fierce gods and noble heroes as an emotional and psychological tactic for instilling a mentality of heroism into their people and soldiers.  These stories helped build a sense of invincibility into the mindset of all sections of Roman life, including into:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>the Roman army and its commanders</li>
       <li>the senators and assemblymen</li>
	   <li>the wives at home</li>
       <li>the children training for war</li>
       <li>the allies of Rome</li>
      
     </ul>
     <p>Mythology helped propel a collective narrative so much that, within Rome, the Romans believed their city was destined to be great.  </p>

  <p>In this module, </p>
         <ul>
           <li>You will read some really fun tales about heroic Roman menâ€”mythological and actual. The Romans would tell these stories around the fireplace to help instill in them a spirit of heroism. </li>
           <li>You will also read stories of heroes, which seem more like a tall legendary tale instead of an actual story. </li>
         </ul>
