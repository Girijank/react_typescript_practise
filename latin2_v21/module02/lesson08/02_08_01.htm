Remember when Aeneas had abandoned my dear Dido, queen of Carthage, for “new Troy”? I never forgave Aeneas for this horrendous act. From that day forward, I promised myself to avenge Dido and my beloved Carthage by bringing great harm upon the descendants of Aeneas. This is the story of how my beloved African nation of Carthage and its mighty leaders almost completely destroyed the city of Roman people, the descendants of Aeneas.</p>

			  <li>Known for their powerful fleet, the Carthaginians dominated the trading routes, which helped them become diplomatic leaders, producers of great luxury goods, and a very wealthy nation. </li>
			  <li>They established colonies on Sicily, Etruria, and western Phoenicia, and they set up alliances with Etruscan kings to protect their trade routes.  </li>
			  <li>Whenever they were attacked, they sent their massive fleet out to stop any uprisings against them. </li>

        <p class="mt-11"><strong>Carthage and Rome Relationship:</strong> As early as the 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE, Carthage recognized Rome’s growing power and thus secured a treaty with Rome to prevent Rome from seizing its trading routes. In return, Carthage promised Rome that it would not harm any of the coastal cities in Latium or any city under Rome’s subjugation. On friendly terms, both cities allowed for their citizens to live in each other’s cities with full citizen rights and protection. The relationship, though, between the two would soon fall apart, and they would go to war!</p>

          <h3>Mercury's Memo: Unfriendly Rhetoric</h3>
          <p>The Romans gave the name Punic to the Carthaginians. It was, in fact, a negative derogatory slur that the Romans called the African nation. </p>
