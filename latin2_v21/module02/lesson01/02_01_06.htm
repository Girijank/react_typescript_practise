		<p>While Winston Churchill was correct that often the perspective of history falls on the side of those who win and conquer, it is not always true. However, we can say with confidence that historians from any age bring their own biases, prejudices, and agendas to their writing. There is a long-standing tradition in Roman historiography to describe Roman conquests of more and more people as protection for Rome and her allies, often with a very thinly veiled reason atop the obvious desire for the glory and profit of military conquest. </p>

		<p>Since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Roman history and culture have been studied and taught through a Euro-centric German scholar lens which has fostered an attitude about classical studies based upon one group’s mindset. As a result, for the 19<sup>th</sup> through 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, there had been a lack of greater diversity in the classics, which have created a racially biased interpretation of the classics. </p>

		<p>In your readings, we provided outlooks on history from as many authentic and non-biased sources academia has to offer. So, as you read, think about how diverse the Roman-Mediterranean world was and how the city of Rome was built with the help of many diverse nations and people. </p>
