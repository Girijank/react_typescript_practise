			<p>I am the inventor of the string musical instrument, the lyre. As a baby, I was so bored in my crib that I crawled out of it and began to roam around in the shadowy cave on Mount Cyllene to which I was born. I saw a tortoise with a speckled shell passing by, and <em><span class="glossary">ego id cepi!</span></em> I then hollowed out its shell, grabbed some reeds, and extended the reeds across the shell. Then, I stretched an oxhide over the shell and made a bridge and two arms. <em><span class="glossary">Mihi nomen est Mercurius, et ego sum saevus!</span></em> Almost complete—I made strings out of sheep gut for my new instrument to finish inventing the first-ever lyre. How clever am I!</p>
