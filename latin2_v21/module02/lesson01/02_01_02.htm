    <h1>The Roman Republic</h1>

    <p class="mt-2">Let’s learn about how Rome became a dominating city and “capital” of the world during the Roman Republic. However, we must remember that Rome grew into this position, and there were many other dominant nations from all across Africa, Asia, Europe, and from the native tribes within Italy who were just as powerful as Rome at one point.</p>

                        <p>After the Roman monarchy&mdash;the rule of seven different kings&mdash;Rome transitioned into a “republic.” This meant that the rule was held by the people and their elected representatives, contrasting the prior monarchs. This transition was neither quick nor easy. It took years to make such major changes. </p>

                            <strong> cursus honorum</strong>, or the sequences of offices, was the various positions held by Roman politicians. The highest position was a
                            <strong>consul</strong> who eventually replaced the kings. Two consuls were elected to serve for a one-year period. Their positions were the top offices in the Senate, and they could veto each other’s decisions. This shared office commanded the army, dealt with foreign affairs, and presided over the Senate and assemblies. During an emergency, a consul could be deemed a
                            <strong>dictator</strong> for six months when the constitution was suspended. When their term in office was complete, a consul could serve as a
                            <strong> pro-consul</strong>, governing over the republic’s numerous territories. </p>

The senators were not elected positions; instead, they were appointed by the censor. This was a lifetime position, without pay. Most were wealthy men and were expected to be of high moral character.
