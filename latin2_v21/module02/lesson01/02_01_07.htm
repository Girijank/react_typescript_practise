		<h1>The Latin Wars</h1>

		<p>Warfare during this time became a central focus in the civic and religious structuring of many Italian
			city-states. In Rome, military service was one of the most important duties for a male citizen and because
			of this, Rome was able to amass a devoted, large army that engaged in warfare against other city-states.
			Even when Rome would conquer another Italian city-state, the city-state would remain fully independent. </p>
		<p>Rome was able to assert itself as the dominant city in Italy during the 6th–4th centuries BCE. During this
			time, Rome was able to establish its dominance over other Italian cities, in part through a series of wars,
			called the Latin Wars between <strong>498 BCE &ndash; 338 BCE</strong>.</p>

							<p>In the first Latin War, the Latins were led by the Etruscan leader and expelled king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and his son-in-law, Mamilius, dictator of Tusculum. The Romans were led by the dictator Postumius and his master of the horse,<span class="glossary">(magister equitum)</span> Titus Aebutius Helva. After six years of back and forth fighting, the Romans defeated the Latins at the Battle of Lake Regillus around 499 BCE—some even say with the help of the twin gods, Castor and Pollux. But the war did not end until the Treaty of Spurius Cassius <span class="glossary">(foedus Cassianum)</span> in 493 BCE, which created a mutual military alliance between the Romans and the Latins with Rome as the principle leader between the two.</p>
