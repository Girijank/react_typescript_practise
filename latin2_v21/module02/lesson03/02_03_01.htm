		<h1><em>E pluribus unum</em></h1>

		<p>The Founding Fathers of the United States modeled the government of the United States on the Roman system of government.  Like the government of the United States, the government of the Roman Republic consisted of consuls, who acted as the Executive Branch.  The Roman Senate acted as the Legislative Branch, and the Roman judges served as the Judicial Branch.  In the United States, the president and vice president serve as the Executive Branch, the Congress and Senate serve as the Legislative Branch, and the U.S. Supreme Court serves as the Judicial Branch.  </p>

			  <p>In addition to contributions in government and the law, the Romans also influenced modern architecture.  For instance, the designers of the Jefferson Memorial took inspiration from the Roman Pantheon to design the structure.</p>

			  <p>The Romans also made significant contributions in the literary arts as well as the visual arts.  For example:</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>The English playwright William Shakespeare used ancient Rome as the theme of several of his plays, such as “Titus Andronicus,” “Julius Caesar,” and “Coriolanus.”</li>
				  <li>Vergil’s literary masterpiece, the <em>Aeneid, </em>influenced later writers, such as Dante Alighieri and John Milton. </li>
			  </ul>

			<div class="col-sm-9">
			  <p>Perhaps one of the most lasting contributions of the Romans was the Latin language itself. </p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>Like modern English, Latin was influenced by many other languages which included Etruscan, Greek, and Phoenician. </li>
				  <li>When the Romans spread their influence through Italy and Europe, they took their Latin language with them which later became the basis for the Romance languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian.   </li>
			  </ul>

		  <p>Over two thousand years separate the time of the Roman Republic from the modern era and yet, the impact of the Romans can still be felt to the present day in television, movies, buildings, laws, and language.  All one has to do is look at the Latin inscriptions on the Great Seal of American currency, such as, <em><span class="glossary">annuit coeptis</span>, <span class="glossary">novus ordo seclorum</span></em> and <em><span class="glossary">e pluribus unum</span>,</em> to get a reminder of the contribution made by the Romans.</p>
