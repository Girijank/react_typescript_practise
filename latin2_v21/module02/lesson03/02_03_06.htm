					schoolchildren took Latin classes! Let’s learn more about how the educational system operated in Rome.</p>

				<p>In ancient Rome, the education system looked very different from what we have today. Although the Greeks had
					a structured, formal education system well before the Romans, ancient Rome formed no such system until around
					the 3rd century BCE. Just like many other facets of Roman daily life, education in Rome, especially during the
					time of the Republic and before, centered around the home and an individual's duty to their family. This
					education, led by the <strong><em><span class="glossary">paterfamilias</span></em></strong>, was just as much
					a moral education as an academic one. </p>

				<p>At this time in Roman history, children learned some reading, writing, and enough mathematics to enable them
					to understand simple business transactions and to count, weigh, and measure. Most learning centered around
					domestic, military, and agricultural skills, all taught by a child's first teachers &mdash;their parents. </p>

				<p>Think of your own upbringing &mdash; was your early education similar to that of a young Roman? Ask your
					family about their own educational upbringings, and then compare stories with what you have learned about
					early Roman education. </p>
