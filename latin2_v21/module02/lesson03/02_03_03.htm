			<div class="content">
				<p>All of this time, you have been translating
					sentences called independent clauses. Have you realized that? Well, I now have a new type of clause
					to introduce you to—dependent clauses!</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<p>When a sentence contains two or more subjects and verbs, the separate parts are called <em>clauses</em>. When
			a group of words can stand by itself as a complete sentence, it is known as an independent clause.
			Independent clauses contain a subject, verb, and complete thought. They can also be very short&mdash;a sentence
			of one or two words!</p>



		<div class="row fev-box-white">
			<div class="col-sm-5">
					<p>Up until now, you have been translating <strong>independent clauses.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Independent Clause Example :</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>The man loves the woman.</li>
					<li>The king and queen live in the village.</li>
					<li>She spoke.</li>
					<li>Hurry!</li>
					<li>They ran.</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-7 border-Left">
				<p>We will now learn about dependent clauses. </p>
				<p><strong>Dependent Clauses :</strong></p>
				<p>A dependent clause is an incomplete thought; it needs to be joined up with a sentence (aka
					independent clause) to complete the thought. What does this mean?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The dependent clause does not have a finish to it, and it needs the help of joining with another
						sentence, an independent clause, to help complete its thought.</li>
					<li>A dependent clause <em>depends</em> on the independent clause to help complete its thought.</li>
					<li>A dependent clause can come before the independent clause. OR, it can come after the independent
						clause. OR, it can come in the middle of an independent clause. No matter where the clause is,
						you will be able to recognize it!</li>
				</ul>

			</div>
		</div>

		<p class="mt-2"><strong>Let's put these two types of clauses together in some examples:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The man, who loves the woman, is a sailor.
				<ul class="dashed">
					<li>Dependent clause: “who loves the woman” Notice how you cannot leave this clause as a stand-alone sentence. It does not have a complete thought. Therefore, it is a <strong>dependent clause</strong>.</li>
					<li>Independent clause:<strong> The man is a sailor.</strong> See how this is a complete sentence and can standalone.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>



			<li>The king and queen, who have three children, live in the kingdom.
				<ul class="dashed">
					<li>Dependent clause: “who have three children” Notice how you cannot leave this clause as a stand-alone sentence. It does not have a complete thought. Therefore, it is a <strong>dependent clause</strong>.</li>
					<li>Independent clause:<strong> The king and queen live in the kingdom.</strong> See how this is a complete sentence and can stand alone.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>



			<li>The sheep, which is standing on the rock, has only one eye.
				<ul class="dashed">
					<li>Dependent clause: “which is standing on the rock” Notice how you cannot leave this clause as a stand-alone sentence. It does not have a complete thought. Therefore, it is a <strong>dependent clause.</strong></li>
					<li>Independent clause: <strong>The sheep has only one eye.</strong> See how this is a complete sentence and can stand alone.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>The grass, which is green, is being eaten by both the goat and the sheep.
				<ul class="dashed">
					<li>Dependent clause: “which is green” Notice how you cannot leave this clause as a stand-alone sentence. It does not have a complete thought. Therefore, it is a <strong>dependent clause.</strong></li>
					<li>Independent clause: <strong>The grass is being eaten by both the goat and the sheep.</strong> See how this is a complete sentence and can stand alone.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
