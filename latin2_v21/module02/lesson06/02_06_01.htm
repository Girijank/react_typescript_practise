				<p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion-Based Assessment—DBA.</strong></p>
				<p>Now you know about the many moving pieces and parts of the Roman Republic—including its governing structure, the Twelve Tables. You also learned about intensive, demonstrative, and relative pronouns and how they are used in Latin and English.</p>
				<p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss these topics with your instructor. Talking about (and in) a foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to practice on your own before your discussion assessment—the more you speak, the more at ease you will feel. Time to dust off this "ancient" language and give it a whirl!</p> 
				<p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact your instructor.</p>
