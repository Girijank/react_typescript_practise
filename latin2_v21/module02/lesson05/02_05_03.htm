				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a place in Roman Republic society.</td>
					<td>Remember:<br />
						The lower you start out on the societal ladder, the more you must do to climb higher!
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 2:</strong> Research: Per the class position you chose, research and write about your role and responsibilities in the Roman Republic. </td>
					<td>Remember:<br />
						For your approximately 150-word paragraph:
						<ul>
							<li>Include the name of your position in your research paragraph. </li>
							<li>Your information must be in complete English sentences.</li>
							<li>Use academic sources and cite them in your Works Cited.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 3:</strong> Latin Composition: Write three sentences <strong>in Latin</strong> about yourself and your life goals in the Roman Republic.  </td>
					<td>Remember:<br />
						You will be writing three sentences in <strong>Latin</strong>. <strong>At least one must include a relative clause</strong>. Your sentences should be simple, using only the vocabulary and grammar you have learned up to this point in the course.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="arrowTD-padding">&#x27A4; Latin sentence 1
						<p class="mb-0">What position in Roman society do you currently hold?</p>
						<p>(Ex. I am a senator who lives in Etruria.)</p>
					</td>
					<td>Remember:
						<p class="mb-0">For your sentence which includes a relative clause, make sure to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Have an independent clause and a relative clause sentence.</li>
							<li>Have your relative pronoun match in gender and number with its antecedent.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="arrowTD-padding">&#x27A4; Latin sentence 2
						<p class="mb-0">What is your main role in Roman society?</p>
						<p>(Ex. As senator, I give advice to the consul.)</p>
					</td>
					<td>Remember:
						<p>If using &ldquo;ut&rdquo; in your description, remember this means &ldquo;as&rdquo; and serves as a connecting word in a sentence. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="arrowTD-padding">&#x27A4; Latin sentence 3
						<p class="mb-0">What is your #lifegoal in the Roman Republic? </p>
						<p>(Ex. In Rome, I wish to be a Roman consul.)</p>
					</td>
					<td>Remember:
						<p>If using &ldquo;cupio&rdquo; in your sentence, remember that it takes a complementary infinitive to complete its action. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right and Wrong Moves: What can you tell your fellow Romans to do (and not do) to advance themselves up the <em>cursus honorum?</em> </td>
					<td>Remember:<br />
						<ul>
							<li><strong>In English,</strong> fill out the chart with three right moves and three wrong moves.</li>
							<li>To make your advice memorable, be sure to include an image for one right move and one wrong move.</li>
						</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong><em>Nota bene</em>:</strong> Did you proofread your work and cite your sources? </td>
					<td>Remember:
						<p>Every sentence should use correct punctuation, grammar, and syntax. All research sources should be cited using MLA format.</p>
