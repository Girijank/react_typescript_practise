                As the god of tricks and clever gambits, I love a good game. Everyone knows that whatever game you play, you have to make the right moves to win. The best games carry the risk of failure—one misstep could send you right back to the beginning.

    <p>To the ancient Romans, the <em>cursus honorum</em> was a very serious game of Life. For them, moving up the
        <em>cursus honorum</em> was life goals. Many scholars liken it to "climbing the corporate ladder." In other words, you campaigned to get a higher government position, possibly even becoming a consul. The right moves would help you rise in the ranks, but the wrong ones could mean losing your title or place in society. No one wants to slide down the ladder!
    </p>

    <h3>Positions of the <em>Cursus Honorum</em></h3>

         data-caption="Ranking in Rome" data-text="textversion/02_05_01_ranking.htm">
    <p>First, take a look at some of the positions of ranking in the
        <em>cursus honorum</em> to understand where you could land as you move up or down the #lifegoals ladder. Move all the way up and you’ll be a
        <strong>consul</strong>! But, oh no—take a misstep, and you could slide all the way down to the
        <strong>plebs</strong> position. </p>

                    <p><strong>Class Position Roles and Responsibilities </strong></p>
                    <p>The Senate functioned as an advisory body. Most were wealthy men and were expected to be of high moral character. In the early Republic, senators had to be members of the patrician class. They did not make laws but would propose decrees and resolutions. In the early Roman Republic, a Roman senator was appointed to the Senate by the consul. </p>
                    <p>Throughout the course of the Republic, a senator could also be selected by censors or consular tribunes. A senate seat was a lifetime position, without pay. Senators had much power in Rome and abroad; they could appoint governors to manage provinces, appoint ambassadors or military legates in war, and in a state of emergency, they could nominate a dictator to manage the city. Senators also were the ultimate oversight counsel for all of Rome’s religious practices. Becoming a senator was an ideal position to have in Rome! </p>
                    <p><strong>Who am I?:</strong> I am a senator who lives in Etruria.</p>
                    <p><strong>What role do I play?:</strong> As senator, I give advice to the consul.</p>
                    <p><strong>#LifeGoals:</strong> In Rome, I wish to be a Roman consul.</p>
