    <p><strong>Step 1: Class Position</strong></p>
    <p>Choose <strong>one class position </strong> from the list below:</p>
    <ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">
      <li>Praetor</li>
      <li>Quaestor</li>
      <li>Aedile</li>
      <li>Censor</li>
      <li>Tribune</li>
      <li>Plebs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2: Class Position Roles and Responsibilities</strong>
    <p>Research the rules and responsibilities of your class position in the Roman Republic. In English, write out the most important details of your role. Make sure you include the following items.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of your social position in the Republic (chosen from the list above)</li>
      <li>Requirements of having this position</li>
      <li>Roles and responsibilities of this position</li>
      <li>Full sentence answers with a minimum of 150 words</li>
      <li>Citation of the sources you used for your research, using MLA format</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use the paragraph written about Senate Roles and Responsibilities on the previous page as an example. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: My #LifeGoals</strong></p>
    <p>Latin Writing Assignment: Choose what position you wish to climb to in the Roman <em>cursus honorum</em>. Write three sentences <strong>in Latin</strong> describing your #lifegoals within the <em>cursus honorum</em>. <strong>At least one sentence must include a relative clause.</strong> Be sure to provide the English translation to your sentences. </p>
    <p>Example: The Senator Who Wants to be a Consul</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sentence 1: Sum senator, qui in Etruria habitat. (I am a senator who lives in Etruria.)</li>
      <li>Sentence 2: Ut senator, Consuli consilium do. (As senator, I give advice to the Consul.)</li>
      <li>Sentence 3: In Roma, consul Romanus esse cupio. (In Rome, I wish to be a Roman consul.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 4: My climb up the <em>Cursus Honorum</em></strong></p>
    <p>As you rise up in the <em>cursus honorum</em> towards your #lifegoals, what advice would you give a fellow Roman squad member on your same career path to accomplish these goals? Answer the following questions in the chart below. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right Moves:</strong> According to the research on your class position, write <strong>three</strong> "right moves" you can take to ascend the social ladder to your desired class position. </li>
      <li><strong>Wrong Moves:</strong> Write <strong>three</strong> "wrong moves" that, in your current position, would keep you from reaching your desired class promotion. Remember, sometimes doing the wrong thing could cause you to lose your position and fall back down the ladder! </li>
      <li> <strong>Nota bene:</strong> You can look to the Twelve Tables as a reminder of what kind of rules Romans were expected to follow during the Republic. </li>
      <li> <strong>Two images:</strong> one right move, and one wrong move. These images can be icons, like on an infographic or sign, reminding your fellow Romans of the right or wrong way to behave, or an image exemplifying the right/wrong action itself. You can draw these images yourself or use a pre-existing image. Just remember, if someone else created the image, you must <strong>cite the source</strong> in the Works Cited section of your template. </li>
    </ul>
