  <h1>To the Republic! </h1>
  <p>As you are on an epic language journey, it is only fitting that you follow me, the mythical patron of travelers. I am Mercury—a tricky Roman deity who also spreads my protection to merchants and thieves alike. Don't worry, I won't lead you astray! </p>
  <p>Select the markers on the picture of me, Mercury, to learn all about my many admirable traits.</p>
