    <ul>
      <li>As the god of travel, I like to think my domain is all places, but no matter where I am, most depict me in motion. My hat is sometimes a helmet, sometimes a traveler's cap—either way, it usually has wings! Some of my Roman nicknames are Mercurius Sobrius or Mercurius Arvernus. In Greek mythology, I am known as Hermes. In Etruscan mythology, I am known as Turms. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I am often depicted with my famous winged sandals and caduceus—a likewise winged staff with two twisting snakes. The staff represents my influence over speakers and writers, but it is also often associated with the medical profession.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the god of tradespeople, I am also featured with a pouch or satchel, much like a shepherd would carry in the field. I may be a trickster, but I pride myself in being the watcher and luck-bringer for the hard-working people of Rome.
