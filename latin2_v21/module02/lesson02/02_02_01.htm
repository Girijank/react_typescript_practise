		<h1>That Republic Lifestyle! </h1>

		<p class="mt-2">In the mid-Republic, your quality of life depended largely on your social status and class. As
			the Romans conquered more and more territory, they gradually extended the rights of citizenship to larger
			groups of people. </p>
		<p>As a Roman citizen (<strong><em><span class="glossary">civis</span></em></strong>) you had the right to vote in
			elections and to use Roman law courts. Only male citizens had the right to wear the toga. Unfortunately,
			Roman women had no legal rights or status of their own. They were almost entirely dependent on their fathers
			and husbands. </p> 
		<p>Slaves (<strong><em><span class="glossary">servi</span></em></strong>)&nbsp;had no rights either. There was,
			however, a large class of freed slaves in Rome (<strong> <em><span
						class="glossary">liberti</span></em></strong>) who enjoyed the right to vote but could not run
			for office themselves. However, the children of freedmen were born free with the full rights of citizenship,
			which provided a degree of upward mobility that wasn’t available in many other ancient societies.</p>
		<p><strong>Social Classes in Rome</strong></p>
		<p>Even as a Roman citizen, your life experience varied vastly depending on your social status and wealth. Roman
			society was largely divided into three social classes:</p>

								assemblies and could pass legislation. Although it was possible for a plebeian to move
								up the political ladder, it was not easy or common. </p>
