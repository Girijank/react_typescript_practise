		<p>It’s me, Mercury! Let’s listen in to another one of my famous tricks! </p>
		<audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_mercury_cattle_culture.mp3"></audio>
		<p>After creating the lyre, <em><span class="glossary">tum ego ad urbem Thessalius cucurri.</span></em> I was
			still a baby and up to no good. I saw a herd of cattle grazing on the mountains and thought up a devious
			plan. I wanted to steal the herd! However, the cattle belonged to my half-brother Apollo, and he would not
			be happy at all with me stealing them from him. So, here’s what I did: I decided to steal only 50 cattle and
			leave no trace of my steps. <em><span class="glossary">Quomodo ego hoc feci?</span></em> I fashioned a pair of
			sandals that I used to fly above the ground so there would be no footsteps, and then I had the cattle walk
			backwards so Apollo would think that the cattle had not left the mountain.<em><span class="glossary">Hoc erat magnum furtim.</span></em> I was so clever! Once I had driven the cattle off the mountains, I sacrificed two
			of the cattle to my fellow gods on Mt. Olympus. To do this, I found sticks and kindling and rubbed them
			together to make fire! I was such a smart baby</p>
