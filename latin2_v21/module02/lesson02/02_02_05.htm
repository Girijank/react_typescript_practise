  <h1>Rome’s Governing Documents</h1>
  <p> Although Rome became a Republic in 509 BCE led by two consuls and the
    Senate, there was a period of time from 451 BCE to 449 BCE during which
    a legislative group of ten men replaced the offices of the two consuls.
    This was group was called the <strong>decemviri </strong>(10 men), short
    for <em><span class="glossary">decemviri legibus scribundis</span></em>. This was also a period of great unrest
    between the upper patrician
    class and the lower plebeian class, due to the inequality of political
    power and rights among them. At this time, there were no written laws,
    and the patricians were demanding that laws be written down to protect
    their rights with regard to their fellow citizens. And so, the decemviri
    got to work….producing what are known as <strong>The Twelve Tables.</strong> </p>

      <p> From historic sources, many of these laws found on the <strong>Twelve Tables</strong> can be read today. Unfortunately, the
        Twelve Tables did not survive in totality to the modern era. They
        were lost in 390 BCE when Rome was sacked by the Gauls. But here is
        some information from the <strong> Twelve Tables </strong>that we do
        have. As you click through this slideshow, remember that these laws
        were written in the 5th century BCE, so they might seem a bit
        archaic in our minds. Remember to use your historical lens when
        reading and interpreting the tables. </p>

      <p> Some of the laws in the Twelve Tables may sound a bit familiar.
        You might be surprised to hear it, but the United States was
        founded on a similar set of guidelines, known as the Bill of
        Rights. The Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments of the
        United States Constitution. After you check out these first 10
        amendments, how do you think they compare to the Twelve Tables of
        Rome? </p>
