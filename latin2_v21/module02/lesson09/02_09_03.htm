		<h1>Second Punic War (218 BCE – 201 BCE)</h1>

		<p>After the First Punic War, Carthage had to pay Rome war reparations. It also needed to pay its allies who
			fought alongside them against Rome. But Carthage was financially exhausted. Therefore, its allies staged a
			revolt, and Hamilcar had to leave Hispania to quash the rebellion in Africa. Rome took advantage of the
			Carthaginian unrest to seize the Carthaginian colony of Sardinia. Carthage responded by driving deeper into
			Hispania under the leadership of Hamilcar. </p>

		<p>Once in Hispania, Hamilcar and Hasdrubal amassed a huge army of over 20,000 (including war elephants), gained
			money from Spanish cities, and took control of the Iberian Peninsula. In 226 BCE, Hasdrubal signed the
			Treaty of Ebro with Rome to not invade Roman allied territories, but two years later he seized the Spanish
			city of Saguntum, a Roman ally. Rome was furious and considered this an act of war. <strong>The Second Punic
				War had begun. </strong> </p>

				<p>The Romans sent their consul Publius Cornelius Scipio and 60 quinqueremes to Hispania to attack the
					Carthaginians. They also sent troops to Sicily. But they had miscalculated Hannibal’s brilliant
					military tactics. Instead of staying in Hispania, Hannibal gathered around 90,000 men, including
					Celtic allies, northern Africans, and Spanish infantries to march towards Italy through the Alps
					mountain range. He also left behind troops in Hispania with Hasdrubal and in other cities that he
					conquered along the way to maintain control over land areas. As he marched, Hannibal’s strategy was
					to win over Roman allies so that the Romans would have no recourse but to make peace with Carthage
					on his terms.</p>

				<p>Hannibal crossed the Alps in 16 days, an almost impossible military feat that cemented his legend as

						60,000 men

					<li>9000 horses

					<li>40 elephants in his infantry</li>

				<p>The march was so grueling and the winter cold so devastating that by the time Hannibal landed in
					Italy, over half of his army had perished, only one elephant had survived, and Hannibal himself had
					gone blind in one eye. </p>

				<p>HIn 218 BCE, Hannibal ambushed the Roman army near the Ticinus River and crushed them. Scipio learned
					about the defeat and headed back to Rome where he and his troops confronted Hannibal at the Trebia
					River. Carthage handed Rome another decisively heavy loss. With his great momentum, Hannibal
					continued to push south towards Rome and handed Rome another huge loss at the Battle of Lake
					Trasimene in 217 BCE. The Carthaginians killed over 15,000 and captured over 10,000 Romans. </p>

				<p>Scipio Africanus then decided to send his brother Calvus to Hispania to intercept Hannibal’s
					reinforcements being sent by his brother Hasdrubal. However, after three straight battle losses, the
					Romans replaced Scipio Africanus with Quintus <span class="glossary">Cunctator</span> Fabius
					Maximus who employed a battle tactic of avoiding engaging in battle with Hannibal in hopes of
					slowing Hannibal’s aggression. The Romans grew restless with Fabius’s delaying tactics and replaced
					him with the consuls, Varro and Paullus. </p>
