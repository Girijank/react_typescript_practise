  <h1>Carthago Delenda Est: Third Punic War (149 BCE–146 BCE)</h1>

            <p>After the Second Punic War, Carthage signed a treaty with Rome that it could never go to
              war without Rome’s
              permission. It also had to pay Rome war reparations. In 153 BCE, the Numidian king
              Massinissa, now an ally
              of Rome, seized parts of Carthaginian land. Carthage asked Rome to intervene, but by
              this time, Rome had
              grown a deep hatred for Carthage. Even in the Roman Senate, Senator Cato the Elder was
              famous for ending all
              his speeches with “<em><span class="glossary">Carthago delenda est</span>!</em>” </p>
            <p>Thus, Rome refused to help Carthage, leaving Carthage to break its treaty with Rome.
              Here’s what happened
              next:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Carthage raised an army against the Numidians, prompting Rome to declare war upon
                Carthage for a <strong>Third Punic War. </strong> </li>
              <li>The Romans demanded Carthage to vacate its own city. </li>
              <li>Rome, now under the leadership of Scipio Aemilianus, lay siege upon Carthage for
                three years and finally
                defeated the Carthaginians in 146 BCE at another Battle of Zama. </li>
              <li>Scipio Aemilianus would also adopt the surname <em>Africanus </em>for his victory in
                the Third Punic
                War. He became Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Aemilianus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Punic Wars were now over. After over one hundred years of battling one another, Rome
              had won, and with
              its victory, had become the most dominant nation in the Mediterranean.</p>

            <p><strong>What happened to Carthage?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rome had destroyed the land of Carthage, sold its residents into slavery, and dumped
                thousands of cubic meters of rubble and debris on top of the city. </li>
              <li>The Romans went so far as to erase not only the physicality of the Carthage city,
                but also its literature and culture by giving away its library to Rome’s allies
                after the war. In this way, Rome was deliberately trying to erase Carthage’s history
                from the record.</li>
              <li>Rome gained control of Carthage’s trade routes, ships, colonies, and many allies,
                which helped Rome increase its wealth, military supply, navy, and agricultural
                landscape. </li>
              <li>With Carthage now destroyed, Rome reigned supreme in the Mediterranean. </li>

            <p><strong>Ethnic Stereotyping</strong></p>
            <p>Rome also had purposefully erased the powerful image of the Carthaginian Empire and its
              leaders by producing literature that contained many negative stereotypes of its African
              people. For example, the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE Roman writer <em>Silius Italicus</em> who wrote <em>Punica</em>, an entire “history” book about the wars, continuously called the
              Carthaginian people impious, deceitful, and wicked. </p>
            <p>Even the name, Punic (which comes from the fabricated Latin word <em>Poenus</em> and its derivative <em>Punicus</em>) was a defamatory term&mdash;an ethnic moniker used to describe the Carthaginian people and culture. These negative, ethnic stereotypes and hatred towards the Carthaginians carried forth into the classical studies of the 19th and 20th centuries, and even up to today, further perpetuating the negative image of the African nation.</p>
