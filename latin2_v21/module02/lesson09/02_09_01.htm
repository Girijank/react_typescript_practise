							<p> <strong>The Barca family</strong> was the ruling family of noble rank who led the
								Carthaginians during the Punic Wars. They were savvy, wise, tactfully fierce leaders who
								expanded the Carthaginian empire throughout Hispania and Italia. Together, this family
								posed the most serious threat to Rome’s power that the Romans had ever seen.</p>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Hamilcar Barca (275 BCE–228 BCE)</strong>:This patriarch had a deep-seated
									hatred for the Romans and wanted to ensure that Carthage remained more powerful than
									Rome. After the First Punic War, he led Carthaginian troops into Hispania to gain
									control of the region. </li>
								<li><strong>Hasdrubal the Fair (270 BCE–221 BCE)</strong>: Hamilcar’s son-in-law. He
									extended Carthaginian command in Hispania and claimed a port city of Hispania as
									<em>“<span class="glossary">Carthago Nova</span>.”</em> There, he signed the Treaty
									of Embro. </li>
								<li> <strong>Hannibal (247 BCE–182 BCE)</strong>:The eldest and most famous son of
									Hamilcar. Hannibal was a military genius and mastermind who led Carthage to multiple
									victories against the Romans.</li>
								<li><strong>Mago (243 BCE–203 BCE)</strong>:Hamilcar’s third son. He fought
									strategically alongside his brothers at almost every battle. </li>

				<p><strong>The Rise of Hannibal, Carthaginian Leader: </strong></p>
				<p> Hannibal is known as one of the
					greatest leaders and military commanders the world has ever known. At an early age, his
					father, Hamilcar, took Hannibal to an altar in Hispania and made Hannibal swear never to be
					a friend to Rome. For his entire life, he carried this hatred towards the Romans. In
					Hispania, he learned battle techniques and war tactics and quickly became known for his
					brilliance and military aptitude. After the assassination of his brother Hasdrubal in 221
					BCE, the Carthaginians immediately elected Hannibal as their commander at the age of 25.
					Hannibal became Rome’s greatest enemy, and he nearly destroyed the Roman Republic in the
					Second Punic War.</p>

				<p><strong>The Rise of Scipio Africanus, Roman Leader: </strong></p>
				<p>Although only in his twenties
					when he assumed command of the Roman army in the Second Punic War, his achievements, wisdom,
					and tactical warfare planning measured far beyond his years. It was his persuasive oratory
					skills combined with his almost “prophetic” foresight, steadfast determinism, and belief in
					self and Roman <em><span class="glossary">mores</span></em> which helped in his pursuit of
					victory. It also seemed as though Scipio structured his command from the “book of Hannibal,”
					wherein his battle and political moves mirrored those of Hannibal early in the Second Punic
					War.</p>
