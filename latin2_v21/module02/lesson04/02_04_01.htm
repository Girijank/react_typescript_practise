		<p>We are enjoying our time learning about the foundations of the Roman Republic and will continue to enjoy it
			while learning more great grammar. But first… more Mercury mischief! Here I am again with another story
			about my tricky ways! Let’s listen in.</p>

		<audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_mercurymischief_culture.mp3"></audio>
		<p>After sacrificing Apollo’s cattle, I went back to my cave on Mount Cyllene and snuck back into my crib with the hope that my mother, Maia, wouldn’t find out what I did. Well, she did and was not happy with me. She called me a thief and scoundrel and a cheat – <em>oh no, harsh words, Mom!
			<span class="glossary">Tum, Apollo ad meum cavum volavit et accusavit me rapiendem bovem eius.</span></em> But I wittingly told him
			that I could never have done such mischievous acts as a little baby. I thought he had believed me, but
			Apollo is a smart god. He called me a magnificent little liar and began to yell at me. Thank goodness, our
			father, Jupiter, heard the arguments and stepped in to mediate. Our father told us to work in harmony to
			wrangle the cattle, and we did just that at first—until Apollo found the remains of the two cattle I
			sacrificed. Oh, he was upset! So, I had to soothe Apollo’s temper with my lyre. He loved the lyre so much
			that I gave it to him, and now the lyre is one of Apollo’s most beloved possessions. Whew, I barely got out of that one!
