                    <p><em>Veturia (or Volumnia) was the mother of a famous general, Gaius Marcius. This woman raised her son to be a good Roman patrician man, who conquered many lands. He captured Corioli, a city of the Volsci, and became Gaius Marcius Coriolanus. Through these many wars, the angry plebeians had refused to fight because they wanted certain rights. Coriolanus did not want the plebs to receive these rights. He spoke against these people; thus, he was expelled from Rome. Coriolanus was angry because of the actions of those ungrateful Romans. He went to the enemy, Tullus Aufidius of the Volsci, and offered to lead their army against Rome.</em></p>
