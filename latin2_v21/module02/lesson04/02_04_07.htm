				<p>The Romans were eager to conquer more regions and
					cities throughout Italy. Yet, the Etruscans, whose kings they had expelled out of Rome, strove to
					keep their independence and civilization free from Roman rule.</p>
				
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>In the midst of the Latin Wars, Rome was also fighting in the Etruscan Wars. The Etruscan city of Veii fought
			three wars with Rome beginning in 483 BCE, including the Veientine War of 437-435 BCE in which Lars
			Tolumnius, King of Veii, was killed, securing <em><span class="glossary">Fidenae</span></em> for Rome. But
			after the Gauls had attacked Rome in 390 BCE at the river Allia, half of the Roman army fled to Veii for
			protection. </p>
		<p class="mt-2">
			The Romans also sent Vestal priestesses and sacred objects to the Etruscan city Cerveteri, creating a mutual
			granting of <em><span class="glossary">hospitium publicum</span></em> by the Romans and Caeretans which
			lasted until 396 BCE. Rome looked at Cerveteri as the center of civilization, even sending their young
			aristocrats there to learn Etruscan literature. Despite this temporary alliance, Rome continued its
			campaigns against Etruria. Between 358 and 351 BCE, Rome and the Etruscan city of Tarquinia were at war.
