        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Let’s listen to hear about the wonderful story of my origin and place in the
          pantheon!</p> <audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_vestaintro_culture.mp3"></audio>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">I was the firstborn child of the Titans Saturn and Rhea. However, I was the
          last-born child that Saturn disgorged from his belly after Jupiter forced Saturn to release the children he
          swallowed. Apollo and Neptune asked to marry me, but I refused their proposals and remained loyal to my sacred
          duties as the goddess of the hearth. I protect the Roman family, hearth, and home with my loving comfort.
          <em><span class="glossary">Sum in meo templo cotidie maneo</span></em> to ensure that I am always maintaining
          a steadfast level of security and warmth to my beloved Romans. </p>
