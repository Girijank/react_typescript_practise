					<p>Vesta was very important to Rome’s religious institution. The Romans created the sacred Cult of
						Vesta, a strictly female cult of six priestesses known as Vestal Priestesses, who tended to the
						hearth of Rome which was the sacred fire that remained lit in the Temple of Vesta located in the
						center of the city. The perennial flame of the fire embodied the life, soul, and eternal power
						of the Rome, and because the Vestal maidens were responsible for keeping the flame lit, they
						were perceived as the sacred lifeline of the city. </p>

					<p><strong>Origins of the Cult</strong></p>
					<p>The Cult of Vesta is intrinsically tied to the very beginnings of the history of Rome.
					<em><span class="glossary">Rhea Silvia, mater primi regis Romae, Romuli, erat virgo Vestalis</span></em>. The second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, is probably best known for creating the priestesshood, since he is credited with creating religious institutions in Rome. At first, there were only two Vestals; then it increased to six over time. The number six is a representation of “selecting” two maidens from the three tribes that created Rome (the Romans, the Sabines, the Etruscans).</p>
