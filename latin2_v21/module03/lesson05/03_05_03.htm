					<td><strong>Step 1:</strong> Did you fill out the character creation chart?</td>
					<td>Remember:<br>
						You will use the chart to write your character description paragraphs.
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 2:</strong> Describe your characters. </td>
					<td>Remember:<br>
						You are writing two descriptions; one for the <em>medicus/medica</em> and one for the member of the
						<em>familia Romana</em>. These descriptions should be:

						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2">&#x27A4; in English</p>
						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2">&#x27A4; around 100 words each</p>
						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2">&#x27A4; based on the research in your chart</p>
						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2">&#x27A4; creative and fun!</p>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td><strong>Step 3:</strong> Write your dialogue.</td>
					<td>Remember:<br>
						Your questions should be <strong>in Latin</strong> , and your answers should be <strong>in English</strong>
						. Don't forget to label who is speaking, and include English translations for the Latin questions.
					</td>

						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2"> &#x27A4; English answer 1:</p>
					</td>
					<td class="mt-1">Remember:
						<p class="mb-1">Interrogative pronouns stand alone in the sentence and do not modify a noun. They are the
							first word in a sentence. They are the “Quis, Quid” pronouns which are declinable.
						</p>

					</td>

					<td><strong>Find out what happened…</strong>
						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2 "> &#x27A4; <strong>Latin question 2:</strong></p>
						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2"> &#x27A4; English answer 2:</p>
					</td>
					<td class="mt-1">Remember:
						<p class="mb-1">Interrogative adjectives are paired with the noun they modify in the same case, number, and
							gender. They are written before the noun and at the beginning of the sentence. They are the “Qui, Quae,
							Quod” adjectives which are declinable.</p>

						<p class="arrowTD-padding mt-2"> &#x27A4; English answer 3:</p>
					</td>
					<td class="mt-1">Remember:
						<p>You can use common question words for this sentence, such as:</p>
						<p>Quando = When?</p>
						<p>Cur = Why?</p>
						<p>Quomodo = How?</p>
						<p>You can also use the enclitic “-ne” to make your question a Yes or No question.</p>
						<p class="mb-1">Don’t forget to use “num or nonne” if you want to make your question rhetorical. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong><em>Nota bene</em>:</strong> Did you proofread your work and cite your sources?</td>
					<td>Remember:
						<p>Every sentence should use correct punctuation, grammar, and syntax. All research sources should be cited
							using MLA format.</p>
