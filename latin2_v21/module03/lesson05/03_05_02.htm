			<p><strong>Step 1: Create your Characters</strong> </p>
			<p>You will be writing your dialogue from the perspectives of a doctor (medicus) and a member of a Republic
				familia Romana. Choose your patient character type from the following list; then complete the chart
				below for both dialogue characters. Your characters can be:</p>
			<ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">
				<li><em>pater</em>: father </li>
				<li><em>mater</em>: mother</li>
				<li><em>paterfamilias</em>: oldest living male in the household</li>
				<li><em>filius</em>: son</li>
				<li><em>filia</em>: daughter</li>
				<li><em>servus</em>: male slave</li>
				<li><em>serva</em>: female slave</li>

			</ul>
			<p>One of the ways you will describe your character is through the Roman virtue they most emulate. You can
				review your <a href="pop/0502_roman_virtue.htm" class="modal-pop">Roman virtues</a> before you start
				your research.</p>


			<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th class="black white-text">&nbsp;</th>
						<th class="black white-text"><em>Medicus/Medica</em></th>
						<th class="black white-text"><em>Familia Romana Character</em></th>

					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Name and role</strong></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Roman virtue that describes this person</strong></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Where this person lives</strong></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><strong>Roles and responsibilities in the Republic</strong></td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>
						<td>&nbsp;</td>

					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>



			<p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2: Describe your characters</strong>
			<p>In English, write out interesting facts about the character. You can be very creative with your
				description, but make sure you are basing your information on your research. Be sure to include the
				following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>name and role of your characters </li>
				<li>a Roman Virtue of the interviewee that best describes the person</li>
				<li>where they live (in the city or in the countryside),including descriptions </li>
				<li>duties within and outside of the household</li>
				<li>style of dress/ how they look</li>
				<li>full sentence answers with a minimum of 100 words each</li>
				<li>citation of the sources you used for your research, using MLA format</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Step 3: Latin Writing Assignment –Medical Emergency Dialog</strong> </p>
			<p>Imagine that a medical emergency has occurred in the household of your Roman family member. Write a
				dialogue between your characters, with your <em>medicus/medica</em> asking <strong>three
					questions</strong> and your <em>familia Romana</em> character providing <strong>three
					answers</strong> in dialogue format. Your <u>questions</u> should be <strong>in Latin</strong> with
				<strong>at least one interrogative pronoun</strong> question and at least one interrogative
				adjective question, with English translations included. The <u>answers</u> to your doctor's
				questions should be <strong>in English</strong>. Be sure to label each line of your dialogue with the
				name of the person speaking.
			</p>

			<p>Example:</p>
			<p>Question 1: <strong><em>Medicus</em></strong>: <em>Quis manum eius cepit?</em> (Doctor: Who took his
				hand?)</p>
			<p>Response 1: <strong>Mother</strong>: Someone cut off his hand.</p>
			<p>Question 2: <strong><em>Medicus</em></strong>: <em>Estne is tutus?</em> (Doctor: Is he safe?)</p>
			<p>Response 2: <strong>Mother</strong>: Yes, the dog is dry now</p>
			<p>Question 3: <strong><em>Medicus</em></strong>: <em>Quid? De quo cane dicis?</em> (Doctor: What? About
				which dog are you speaking?)</p>
			<p>Response 3: <strong>Mother</strong>: Not my dog.</p>


			<p><em><strong>Nota Bene:</strong></em> These sentences have been taken from the story, “The Doctor and the
				Soldier’s Lost Hand.” Your dialogue should center around a new medical emergency of your choosing.
