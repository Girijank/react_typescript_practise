			Having a daughter selected as a Vestal Priestess was highly coveted by a
			Roman noble family. Vestal Priestesses were revered for their modesty
			and duty to the Roman state. The
			<span class="glossary">Pontifex Maximus</span> would select twenty girls
			of high esteem between the ages of 6 to 10 to possibly become a Vestal
			Priestess. Selection to the cult of six was then done by a lottery.
		</p>
		<p>
			The girls would then live with the other Vestal Priestesses for a period
			of thirty years. The chief priestess was called the
			<em>Vestalis Maxima</em> This is how their duties went:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				First ten years: Learn how to conduct the duties of the position.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next ten years: Perform their religious duties, including tending to
				the fire, leading multiple religious ceremonies (including watching
				over the Vestalia festival and Lupercalia festival), and performing
				other duties such as, sweeping the temple steps or pardoning criminals.
				They were even entrusted with wills for safe-keeping—even the wills of
				the Roman Emperors.
			</li>
			<li>
				Last ten years: Educate and train the newly selected priestesses.
			</li>
		</ul>
