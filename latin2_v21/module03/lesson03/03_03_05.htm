			<p><strong>Living in the city was not glamorous. Rome was filthy! Let’s listen in to hear how your life
					would be if you lived in Rome. </strong></p>
			<audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_citylife_culture.mp3"></audio>
			<p>A foul stench of the sewer and human waste hurled from the windows of insulae floats through the air as you
				pass by the shops. You notice a butcher opening his shop, animal meat hanging from its doors. Even though Rome
				had a working sewage system, this didn’t stop the city’s lower-class residents from throwing waste out their
				windows (though this violated the law). <em><strong><span class="glossary">Odor erat pessimus!</span></strong></em>. In your walk through the city, you see many slaves and freed slaves from
				around the empire. Next on your stroll, you might see priests from one of the many temples of different gods
				taking offerings from those who seek some favor from this deity. You might not see many free men in the city
				since many men took up residence in provinces, where they could have a farm, because Italy was too expensive. If
				you ventured into the countryside, you would see<em> <strong><span class="glossary">magnas villas</span></strong></em>owned <em><strong><span class="glossary">a nobilitatibus,</span></strong></em>
				where <em><strong><span class="glossary">magnus numerus servorum</span></strong></em> would work the fields. You
				would find your way to the villa of your patron, a nobleman for whom you would show support and provide services
				and from whom you also would receive support.
