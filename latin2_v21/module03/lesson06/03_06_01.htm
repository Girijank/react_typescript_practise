				<p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion-Based Assessment—DBA</strong>.</p>
				<p>Now you know more about Roman life in the time of the Republic and the Roman family. You also learned
					how to translate nouns in the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Declensions and how to use
					interrogatives to ask questions.</p>
				<p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss these topics with your instructor. Talking about (and in) a
					foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to practice on your own before your discussion assessment&mdash;the more you speak, the more at ease
					you will feel. Time to dust off this "ancient" language and give it a whirl! </p>
				<p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact
					your teacher.</p>
