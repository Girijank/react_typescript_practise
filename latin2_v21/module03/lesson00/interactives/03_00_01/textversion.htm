      <li>I am often depicted as a beautiful, yet humble young woman—much like the Vestal Priestesses who join my temple. You can often identify me by my hair, which I always wear tied up or hidden under a veil. Vesta is my Roman name. I am typically just called <em>Mater </em> because of my motherly warmth. In Greek mythology, I am known as Hestia. In Etruscan mythology, I am Ethausva. 
      </li>
      <li>
        As protectress of the home, I am often depicted with the most essential, central part of any Roman household—the hearth. All duties related to the household fall under my domain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many images you will find of me show me carrying a torch. This torch is a symbol of my eternal flame, which my Vestal Priestesses are charged with tending and protecting. It was their sacred mission to never let my fire go out.
