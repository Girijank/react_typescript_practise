		<h1>Growth of a Civilization</h1>

		<p>Welcome back to my home sweet home—Rome! The time of the Republic saw a lot of growth for the Romans—especially when it came to the home and family lives of Rome's citizens. As the Olympian charged with watching over domestic affairs, I, Vesta, am proud to guide you through this part of Roman history and culture!</p>

		<p>Come, sit by my hearth, and I will tell you all about myself. Select the markers on my image.</p>
