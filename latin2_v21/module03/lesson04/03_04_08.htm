            <h4>Four Humors</h4>
            <p>Read the passage below about the four humors. Then, translate the questions about the passage below. Then, answer its corresponding questions. You will submit your translations and answers to your teacher for a grade. Make sure to use the Useful Tips!</p>
            <p>Ancient doctors believed that there were four humors in the human body. They were blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Each of the humors was associated with an element: black bile for earth, phlegm for water, yellow bile for fire, and blood for air. For a person to be healthy, all four humors must be equal in his or her body. The humors also determined the behavior or temperament of a person. The theory of the four humors originated in ancient Greece and was part of the principal teachings of the Greek physician, Hippocrates. He was also known for what we now call the Hippocratic Oath: “First do no harm.” Modern doctors often choose to take this oath at the end of their studies.</p>

              <h4>Translation Checklist</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Have you identified the tense, voice, person, number, and mood of the verb?</li>
                <li>Have you identified the case, number, and gender for the nouns and adjectives?</li>
                <li>Do your English definitions for each of the words in the Latin translation match the
                  definitions found in the toolbox dictionary?</li>
                <li>Have you double-checked your Latin vs. English word order?
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>HINT</strong>: In Latin, adjectives follow the nouns they modify, genitive nouns follow
                      the nouns they possess, and verbs are typically found at the end of the
                      sentence.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Did you transfer all punctuation from Latin to English?</li>
