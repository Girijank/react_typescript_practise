		<h1>The Roman Doctor</h1>
		<p>Living in Rome and fighting for Rome took its toll on the Roman people. Disease, sickness, and war injuries were commonplace. So-called medical doctors performed strange procedures to help cure the sick and wounded. Let's learn more about these Roman doctors!</p>

				<p>Rome’s greatest physician, Galen, who hailed from Greece, discusses his thoughts on the

				<h3>Vesta's Advice: Straight from the Source!</h3>
				<p>Whenever you see "Straight from the Source!" you are reading authentic Latin text written
					directly by an actual ancient Roman author. The Latin might seem a bit foreign to you because
					there might be words or forms you don't recognize. Try your hand at translating it because the
					more you practice, the better you’ll become at your Latin! It’s always fun to translate Latin
					straight from the source!</p>

					<h4>The Wounded Aeneas</h4>
					<p>In Book XII of the <em>Aeneid</em>, Aeneas is wounded by a stray arrow. A doctor, Iapyx, comes to the battlefield to try to heal the wound, but he is not able to remove the arrow. So, Aeneas's mother, Venus, sends down a healing balm to help the doctor remove the arrow from the leg of Aeneas. The doctor then closes Aeneas's wound and Aeneas is ready to fight once more. </p>
