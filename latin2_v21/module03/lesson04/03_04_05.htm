        <p>Have you ever heard of the joke "who's on first"?
          Sometimes, even in English, pronouns can be comically tricky. Here are some ways to distinguish between all
          the Latin pronouns that even the Romans would have had a good chuckle about!</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Interrogative or Relative?</h3>
    <p>Here are the three simple rules for distinguishing between interrogative adjectives, interrogative pronouns, and
      relative pronouns:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If there is no question mark, it is a relative pronoun.</li>
      <li>If it has a question mark and the "q" word agrees with a noun (usually next to it), it is an interrogative
        adjective.</li>
      <li>If none of those fit, it is the interrogative pronoun.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><em>Exerceamus</em></h3>
    <!-- <p>Identify whether each sentence or question below contains a relative pronoun, interrogative pronoun, or
      interrogative adjective.</p> -->
