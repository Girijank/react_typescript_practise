    <p>
      The Romans did not have question marks. Thus, they used question words
      at the beginning of sentences to propose a question. Remember
      these question words?

              When -ne is attached to a word, it means that you are now
              translating a question and not a sentence. The -ne is normally
              attached to the verb, but you might find it attached to the noun
              subject as well. Example:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><em>Vir feminam amat. </em>The man loves the woman.

            <p>A Latin word which changes the sentence

        <h3>Vesta’s Advice: Non & Ne</h3>

        <p>Remember "<strong>Non</strong>"?</p>
        <p>
          The Latin word "<strong>Non</strong>" means "<strong>not</strong>."
          Therefore, when you see it in the sentence, the translation of the
          sentence now has a negative word in it. Simply translate the “non”
          where it lies within the Latin sentence.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><em>
            Qui vir feminam "<strong>Non</strong> duxit?</em> Who did not lead the
          men into battle?
        </p>

        <p>Remember "<strong>ne</strong>"?</p>
        <p>
          The Latin word "<strong>ne</strong>" means "<strong>no</strong>."
          Therefore, when you see it in the sentence, simple translate it as a
          simple "<strong>No.</strong>" .” It is normally an answer to a
          question. It stands alone in a sentence. Example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><em>
              Amatne vir feminam ? <strong>Ne!</strong></em> Does the man love the
            woman? <strong>No!</strong>
          </li>
          <li><em>
              Caperne a lupa devorabaur? <strong>Ne!</strong></em> Was the goat being
            devoured by the wolf? <strong>No!</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
