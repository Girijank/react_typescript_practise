	<p>By the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE, Rome had over one million people living in its city! The population was a mixture of native Romans and non-native people.  It was extremely diverse!  People moved into Rome for opportunity, for social and political advancement, and for all the benefits of city living.  Roman allies and people conquered in war found their way into Rome.  On one block you could find:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Native Romans and Italians conquered during the wars</li>
	    <li>Greeks</li>
		<li>Etruscans</li>
		<li>Africans</li>
		<li>Spaniards</li>
		<li>Celts</li>
		<li>Turkish</li>
		<li>Asian</li>
		<li>Northern Europeans</li>
		<li>And so many more!</li>

	</ul>
	<p>All of these individuals helped create a melting pot environment in the Roman city. They helped contribute to Romeâ€™s architectural and engineering advancements, medical advancements, and literature growth.  The city of Rome had now become the most multilingual and multi-diverse place on earth! </p>

				<h3> <em>Cogitavisti?</em> Did You Know?</h3>
				<p>The Romans did not view race in the same social constructs of the modern world. In fact, there was no creation of a caste system based upon the skin color of an individual living in the ancient world. The Romans cared more about who they could conquer and who could contribute to the growth of their nation. They did not set out to conquer or subjugate individuals based upon skin color. Thus, all types of peoples from Africa, Asia, and Europe co-existed in Rome without the racial bias constructs that exist in the modern world.</p>
