		<h1>Roman Home Decor</h1>
		<p>Romans decorated their homes with much ostentation because Roman houses were signs of a person’s social hierarchy. In Cicero’<em>s de Officiis</em>, Cicero states that the <em>dominus</em> of the house should design their home to distinguish his own dignity and then to give attention to persons entering the house.</p>

		<li>Glass bowls were featured on their painted walls.</li>
		<li>Still-life images of translucent, white-colored large bowls with fruit were displayed in many of the elite villas and homes in Rome, Campania, Pompeii, and Herculaneum from the late first century BCE through the first century CE.  </li>
