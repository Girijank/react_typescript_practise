          Two of the central tenets of education in early Rome were the ideas of the <strong><em><span
                class="glossary">vir bonus</span></em></strong>
          and the <strong><em><span class="glossary">mos maiorum</span></em></strong>. These ideals taught Roman
          children to be good citizens and focused on not only basic life skills, but also on the traditional
          social code that made up a successful Roman community.

          It was not until later in the age of the Republic that the idea of a school, or <strong><em><span
                class="glossary">ludus</span></em></strong> began to spread in Rome. The focus of these schools was for
          young children to socialize in the community and learn basic academic skills. Around the latter half of the
          3rd century BCE, Spurius Carvillius Ruga, a former slave turned freedman and teacher, opened the first
          fee-based primary school. He is also credited as the first person to use the letter "G" in place of the letter
          "C" for the sound /g/. His school used Greek methods of education that quickly rose in popularity in the later
          years of the Republic.
