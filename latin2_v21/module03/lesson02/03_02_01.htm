									her future husband. When handed over, she would be known as <em>cum manu</em> (with binding). If she stayed
									under the property of her father, she was known as <em>sine manu</em> (without binding). She would normally be confined to her home and to her weaving duties. However, if she worked outside of the home, she could hold a job
									such as a butcher, an entertainer, a fisher, or a secretary. Some women were also
									physicians, construction workers, or businesswomen.</p>

										eligible for military duty. He would assume a <em>toga virilis</em> (manly toga) at that time. We’ll be learning more about the education of

									Roman families had slaves that took care of the household chores, accompanied the

									the wives to outside events. Slaves were considered part of the Roman family
									structure. A household slave could be a Roman, an Italian, an individual from a
									conquered nation, or an individual without a family of his or her own. Slaves would
									hold jobs such as a teacher, an accountant, or a craftsman. Slavery was a temporary
									condition for those who could buy their freedom or for those who did such exemplary
									work;their master would reward them with their freedom. </p>
