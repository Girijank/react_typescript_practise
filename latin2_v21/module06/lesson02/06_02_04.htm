				<p><strong>Remember the indirect statement checklist?</strong></p>
				<p>&#10004; The main “sensory” verb: within the independent clause </p>
				<p>&#10004; The Accusative subject: begins the Accusative-infinitive (dependent) clause</p>
				<p>&#10004; The infinitive verb: at the end of the entire sentence, part of the dependent clause</p>
				<p>According to your indirect statement formula, we know that the verb within the Accusative-infinitive clause
					will be in the infinitive form. But how do you translate it? </p>
				<ul>
					<li>First, Latin only uses three <a href="pop/06_02_04_pop.htm" class="modal-pop">Infinitive</a> tenses for
						the indirect statement:
						<ul>
							<li>Present infinitive (Active or Passive): </li>
							<li>Perfect infinitive (Active or Passive)</li>
							<li>Future infinitive (Active or Passive)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

		<p>The translation of the infinitive tense depends on the tense of the main verb. Think of the infinitive forms as
			points on a tense timeline:</p>

				<h3>Apollo’s Aim: Ask your Instructor</h3>
				<p>If you’d like further explanation as to why the infinitive tenses translate in these ways, this would be a
					good time to call your teacher for discussion. Your instructor can provide the <em>how</em> behind the
					<em>why</em>. Maybe we don’t always have to ask the Romans after all…</p>
