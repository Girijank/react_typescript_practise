				<p>I am the patron god of poets! Ancient poets turned to me for inspiration and dedicated their works to me.
					Yes, poets had a mortal patron who financed their art, but I am the only one to whom a poet should truly give
					any credit!</p>

				<p>Poetry was mostly a spoken art form, performed and recited at festivals and public readings. Poets needed
					someone to finance their artwork, since there was no governmental support or institution that paid for poets
					to produce poems. Therefore, they would turn to a patron, a wealthy individual who provided money, gifts, and
					the means by which to perform their poems. </p>

						<li>greet his patron early in the morning at his house</li>
						<li>travel with his patron into the city to attend meetings in the forum</li>
						<li>provide his patron electoral support when needed</li>

									<p>My name is <strong>Maecenas. I am a patron who</strong> financed an entire literary movement during
										the Augustan Age. I formed the “circle of Maecenas” which consisted of the leading literary minds in
										Rome. This “circle of Maecenas” helped Augustus craft his literary agenda and propaganda. Without my
										money, clout, and support, we might not have ever had the works of the poets Vergil, Horace, and
										Propertius. <em><span class="glossary">Augusto magnus amicus eram</span></em>. When Octavian was
										abroad before becoming emperor, I helped manage Rome in his absence. I then became a trusted advisor
										to Augustus during his reign. Augustus, through me, would commission these poets to write their
										poems. The emperor would make a request for a specific poem topic and style, and I would pass it
										on—but those moody poets would sometimes write what the muses inspired in them, producing love
										elegies rather than epics.</p>

				<p> The technical name for “creative license” in Roman literature is called a <em>recusatio</em>.</p>
				<p>Think of a patron like a sponsor in today’s world. Athletes, social media influencers, and artists have
					sponsors who provide money and access to these individuals. This is what a Roman patron did, too!</p>
				<p>Can you think of any wealthy individuals or corporations who finance poets today? </p>
