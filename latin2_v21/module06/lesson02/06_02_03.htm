				<p>There are three key parts to an indirect statement in Latin:</p>
				<p>&#10004; The main “sensory” verb: within the independent clause</p>
				<p>&#10004; The Accusative subject: begins the Accusative-infinitive (dependent) clause</p>
				<p>&#10004; The infinitive verb: at the end of the entire sentence, part of the dependent clause</p>
				<p><strong>We’ll use this Latin indirect statement sentence as our base example:</strong></p>
				<p><em>Dicit virum feminam amare</em>. = He says that the man loves the woman.</p>
				<p><strong>This might seem strange to you, so let’s break down how this is an indirect statement sentence
						through our checklist:</strong></p>
				<p>Dicit [virum feminam amare.] = He <em>says</em> that the man loves the woman.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Dicit</em> = main sentence (independent clause)
					</li>
					<li>[<em>virum feminam amare</em>] = (Accusative-infinitive, dependent clause)</li>
				</ul>
				<table class='table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped mt-2 table-border'>

							<td>Main “Sensory” Verb</td>

		<p>Let's take a look at what each piece does for our indirect statement formula: </p>
		<div class="tabs">
			<a class="tab tab1" title="Roman wine jars">Main "Sensory" Verb (Independent Clause)</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Remember, “sensory verbs” are verbs of <em>thinking, saying, telling, knowing, perceiving, showing,
						hearing</em>, or anything that can take place in one’s head. Those type of verbs can introduce an indirect
					statement clause. We use these sensory verbs in the independent clause to introduce an indirect statement.</p>
				<p>Check out our sentence: <strong><em>Dicit</em></strong><em> virum feminam amare.</em> = <strong>He says</strong> that the man
					loves the woman.</p>
				<p>“Dicit” comes from <em>dico, dicere, dixi, dictus,-a,-um = to say</em>. It’s a sensory verb! It is also the
					main verb of the sentence, acting as an independent clause. </p>
			</div>
			<a class="tab tab1" title="header title inside content area"> The Accusative-Infinitive Clause (Accusative
				Subject)</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The dependent clause in an indirect statement is called an <strong>Accusative-infinitive clause</strong>. The
					word functioning as the subject within the Accusative-Infinitive clause is in the Accusative case! Why? Ask
					the Romans…</p>
				<p>Check out our sentence: <em>Dicit</em> [<strong><em>virum</em></strong><em> feminam amare.</em>] = He says that <strong>the man
					</strong> loves the woman. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Virum</em> = the man = the subject of the Accusative-infinitive clause which is “the man loves the woman.”</li>
					<li>Virum is in the Accusative case because the subject of the Accusative-infinitive clause in Latin is
						written in the Accusative case.</li>
					<li><strong><em>Nota bene:</em></strong> The “Accusative-subject” of the Accusative-infinitive clause is
						normally written right after the main sensory verb. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<a class="tab tab1" title="header title inside content area">The Accusative-Infinitive Clause (Infinitive
				Verb)</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The verb within the Accusative-infinitive clause will always be in an infinitive form! However, you will not
					translate it as an infinitive; instead, you’ll translate this like a normally conjugated verb. Why again? Ask
					the Romans…</p>
				<p>Check out our sentence: <em>Dicit</em> [<em>virum feminam <strong>amare</strong>.</em>] = He says that the man <strong>loves</strong> the woman. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><em>amare</em> = loves </strong></li>
					<li><em>amare</em> = present Active-infinitive. But it is not translated like its infinitive form (“to love”) — remember
						to drop the "to"! </li>
					<li><strong><em>Nota bene:</em></strong> The tense used by the infinitive in translation depends on the tense
						of the main verb. You will learn how these tenses function in future lessons. </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Apollo’s Aim: that</h3>
				<p>In order to put your translation in good English word order, you will insert the English word
					<strong>“that”</strong> before the Accusative-infinitive (dependent) clause. </p>
				<p>The word <strong>“that”</strong> will not appear in the Latin sentence, so it is up to you to add it into
					your English translation.</p>
