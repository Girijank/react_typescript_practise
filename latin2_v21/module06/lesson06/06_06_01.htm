        <p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion-Based Assessment&mdash;DBA</strong>. </p>
        <p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss poetry and indirect statements with your instructor. Talking about
          (and in) a foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to
          practice on your own before your discussion assessment&mdash;the more you speak, the more at ease you will
          feel. Time to dust off this "ancient" language and give it a whirl! </p>
        <p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact your
          teacher.</p>
