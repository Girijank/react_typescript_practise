				<ul>
					<li>If someone is <em>thinking, saying, telling,  showing, hearing</em> (or doing anything that can
						take
						place (or <em>sensing</em>) in one’s head), then they can introduce an <strong>indirect statement</strong>. We call these verbs “sensory verbs.”</li>
					<li>Think of other words in the same family: say, tell, report, announce, etc. You will notice that the word
						<em>that</em> naturally follows each one. For example:
						<ul>
							<li>I hear that...</li>
							<li>I know that...</li>
							<li>I feel that…</li>
							<li>I say that…</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The Latin sensory verbs that introduce indirect statements are listed in your vocabulary in this lesson.
						There
						are others to learn as well. I sense that you can match the sensory verbs to their corresponding pictures!
					</li>
