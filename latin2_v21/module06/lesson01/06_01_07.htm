      <p> There was a genre in Roman literature called <em>love elegy</em>. Love elegy poets wrote emotional poems
        that would tear at your heartstrings! The Roman love elegists were: </p>
      <div style="margin-left:300px;">
        <ul>
          <li>Catullus</li>
          <li>Gallus</li>
          <li>Propertius</li>
          <li>Tibullus</li>
          <li>Ovid</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Catullus, the Love Elegist</h4>
      <p>Many of Catullus’s poems were addressed to his girlfriend, Lesbia. If you read his poems, you’ll witness a man
        in love, then out of love, then bitter about his breakup, and then very emotional because he wants Lesbia
        back. There are so many emotions in his poems that it plays out like a modern-day telenovela!</p>
      <h4>Heart break Hotel</h4>
      <p>Think of these great love elegists as modern-day chart-topping singers with songs that forever stir our
        emotions. Take a look at the Latin love elegies and see how these modern pop songs compare to them.</p>
