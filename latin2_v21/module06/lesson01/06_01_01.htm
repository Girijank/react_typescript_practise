				<p>You are very familiar with Vergil’s epic poem the <em>Aeneid</em>, which was written during the age of
					Augustus. Let’s travel back 100 years before that, when the first Roman poets were inspired to write poetry.

				<p class="arrowTD-padding">&#x27A4; Lucius Livius Andronicus from southern Italy had his hand in transcribing the <em>Odyssey</em> into Latin after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Punic War. </p>
				<p class="arrowTD-padding">&#x27A4; Then, there was Gnaeus Naevius, who wrote epic poetry in the third century
					BCE. </p>

				<h4>The Path of Roman Poetry</h4>
				<p>By the end of the second century BCE, amateur groups of poets who regarded poetry as a pastime began to
					assemble in Rome. This led to a poetic revolution in the first century BCE in which a new group of poets
					called “novi poetae” or “neoterics” began to meet in groups and model the purpose and expression of their
					poetry after the third century BCE Greek Alexandrian poets and the Greek poet Callimachus. </p>
