  <h2>Indirect Statement Formula&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: Indirect statements occur when a speaker reports what someone else has said, done, or thought. </p>
  <p>They don't relay information; they tell you about that information. </p>
  <p>[On screen text: <strong>Sarah said that</strong> Carlos is in first place. <strong>I think that</strong> you're the winner of the contest. <strong>Mrs. Collins knows that</strong> our team will probably be last.] </p>
  <p>In Latin, indirect statements will always follow a formula, making long sentences easier to recognize and translate.</p>
  <h3>Indirect Statement Formula</h3>
  <p>A Latin sentence needs three parts to be considered an indirect statement: </p>
  <p>First, a main clause using a sensory verb. </p>
  <p>Then, a subject for the indirect statement in the accusative case. </p>
  <p>Last, an infinitive acting as the verb in the indirect statement. </p>
  <p>[On screen:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Main Sensory Verb</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Accusative Subject</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Infinitive Verb</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are being emphasized as the announcer mentions them.] </p>
  <p>Let's look at the sentence: "Puella dicit puerum eam amare." </p>
  <p>The main clause is indicated by the sensory verb "<strong>dicit</strong>," or "she says." [On screen: "Dicit" is circled in the sentence "Puella <strong>dicit</strong> puerum eam amare."] </p>
  <p>Test whether the sentence is an indirect statement by using the word "that" in translation following the main verb. </p>
  <p>[On screen: "Dicit puerum eam amare." with translation "She says that the boy loves her." "That" is highlighted in the sentence "She says that the boy loves her."] This one translates as: "She says that the boy loves her." </p>
  <p>Look at the indirect statement portion of the sentence: <strong>puerum eam amare</strong>. [On screen text: "Puerem eam amare" is circled in the sentence "Dicit <strong>puerum eam amare</strong>." "That" is highlighted in sentence translation "She says that the boy loves her."] </p>
  <p>Part 2 is the accusative subject of the indirect statement, which follows the sensory verb in the sentence. </p>
  <p>In this case "<strong>puerum</strong>," <strong>the boy</strong>, is the subject. [On screen text: "Puerum" is circled in the sentence "Dicit <strong>puerum</strong> eam amare." "The boy" is underlined in the sentence "She says that the boy loves her."] </p>
  <p>The infinitive verb, "<strong>amare</strong>," is part 3 of the indirect statement formula. [On screen text: "Amare" is circled in the sentence "Dicit puerum eam <strong>amare</strong>.) "Loves her" is underlines in the sentence "She says that the boy loves her."] </p>
  <p>Put together, it makes the indirect statement "<strong>The boy loves her.</strong>" [On screen text: "Puerum eam amare" is circled in the sentence "Dicit <strong>puerum eam amare</strong>." "The boy loves her" is underlined in the sentence "She says that <em>the boy loves her</em>."] </p>
  <p>Using the formula, we know that the phrase "the boy loves her" is indirectly said by the girl. </p>
  <p>That makes the sentence an indirect statement. </p>
