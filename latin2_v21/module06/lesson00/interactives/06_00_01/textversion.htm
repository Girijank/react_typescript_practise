    <ul>
      <li>More often than not, you will see me depicted as a handsome, golden-haired youth; some say my beautiful locks glow with the light of the sun, which is my domain. In both Roman and Greek mythology, I am known as Apollo. In Etruscan mythology, I am Apulu.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the patron god of music and art, I am frequently portrayed holding the lyre—my instrument of choice. I am often associated with all things beautiful and graceful, including the lovely dolphin—dancer of the sea.
      </li>
      <li>
        Much like my sister Diana, many images show me holding my weapon of choice—a bow and arrows. Though I love creation and all things beautiful, I have been known to slay my fair share of enemies—both monsters and men.
