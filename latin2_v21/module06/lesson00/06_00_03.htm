        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">You have finished the introduction lesson. This lesson introduced you to your Olympian narrator for this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>&mdash;Apollo, Olympian deity of all things art and performance. His aim will be to conduct your Latin skills on your way to Latin mastery! Watch for his important highlights throughout these lessons.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">For your next adventure, you will take a pretest with questions on the material for this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> to see what you already know. Don't worry&mdash;this assessment will have very little impact on your overall score for the course. However, it will give you a clue about what's to come in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. It will also help you understand how you will be assessed at the end of the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>.
