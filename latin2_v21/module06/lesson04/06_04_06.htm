    <h1><em>Fabula Fabulosa:</em> Apollo and Daphne</h1>

    <p> The Roman elegist Ovid wrote the best mythological stories in his
      <strong><em>Metamorphoses.</em></strong> Listen to the story about
      Apollo and the nymph Daphne in Apollo’s own words. </p>

          <p>One day I saw the cherubic god, Cupid, out and about with his bow and arrows, and we got into an argument over who could use the bow best. Didn't he see me just kill the giant python? He so arrogantly said that his bow and arrow are more powerful because it made people fall in love. So, he shot me with his arrow! <em>Ouch, Cupid!</em> </p>

          <p> I felt overcome with emotion, and when I saw the beautiful
            river nymph Daphne in the woods with her hair tied in a bow, I
            immediately fell in love with her! So, I pursued her, wanting
            to marry her. Was this the work of Cupid?
            <em><span class="glossary">Ita</span></em>! But, I couldn’t help it; I chased her, trying to get her to
            stop to speak with me. But, she ran swiftly and kept running
            away from me.
            <em><span class="glossary">Illa me non voluit</span></em>. I even told her I was a god, the son of
            Jupiter, in hopes
            of persuading her, in hopes she, with her flowing locks, would
            fall in love with me. It didn’t work. She cried out to her
            father to help her, to put an end to this chase, which he did.
            Her father, Peneus, stopped her in her tracks, turned her hair
            into leaves, her arms into branches, and her feet into roots.
            Her face had become a canopy. My lovely Daphne had been turned
            into a laurel tree! </p>

            Because of my arrogance and also because of that scoundrel Cupid, this poor girl is a girl no more. So, I decided from that day on that the laurel wreath, her honor, shall be worn by Romans—generals, competitors, emperors, to honor them in their heroic efforts. In this way, my Daphne's life will have meaning forevermore.</p>
