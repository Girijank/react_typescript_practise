        <p> Love and War? Yes, the two do coexist. Some of our best Latin poetry was formed as a result of the poet’s
          sentiments about the wars in which Rome fought!</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>What type of poetry would you write if you lived through three Civil Wars, the assassination of Julius Caesar,
      the end of the Roman Republic, the rise of the sole leader, Augustus, and the rise of the new Roman Empire? Can
      you imagine the material you could rely on? </p>

    <p>War helped shape the poetry of the Roman Republic and Empire. This was true, and Roman poets, like many artists before and after, created works of social commentary on the times in which they lived. The Civil Wars and the
      destruction of the Roman Republic had disrupted the social fabric and the principles of social equity, virtue, and
      freedom upon which Rome had operated. The Roman poets who lived through these troubling times took to their
      <em><span class="glossary">papyri</span></em> to provide their own personal commentaries about the downfall of the
      Roman Republic.
    </p>
    <p>But poets had to be careful not to outright present Rome as the corrupt, morally decaying city that it had
      become. This was especially true for those who were commissioned by Augustus to write about the restored glory of
      the city. When you read Latin poetry, imagine the difficulties poets must have had to both produce authentic
      artwork, while still being loyal to their patron.</p>

    <p>Our Roman poets, Catullus, Horace, Vergil, Propertius, and Tibullus, all wrote through this double-edged lens.
      For example, Catullus's <em>Carmina</em> constantly criticizes the moral decay of the Roman politician. He even calls Julius
      Caesar “<em><span class="glossary">pathico Caesari</span></em>.” Catullus himself tried to stitch together a moral
      code for Roman society throughout his poems. He attempted to get people to turn to poetry as an escape from the
      heavy burden of the Civil War!</p>

        <h3><em>Cogitemus!</em></h3>
        <p>Julius Caesar was assassinated between the publication of Catullus’s <em>Carmina</em> and Horace’s
          <em>Odes</em>. What effect do you think Caesar’s rise and fall would have had on your average Roman citizen
          reading poetry? </p>

        <p> Do you see a parallel between the Roman poets and our modern comedic writers or late night television hosts?
          They are all the social commentators of their time.</p>
