		<p class="mt-3">Listen to the story about how Apollo slayed a giant python! </p>
		<audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_apollostory01_culture.mp3"></audio>
		<p><em><span class="glossary">Etiam ego sum pugnator</span></em>, like my twin sister, Diana. Before I was born,
			my father, Jupiter, had an affair with my mother, Leto. Juno, of course, was extremely upset, and so she
			sent down a giant python to chase Leto around. <em><strong>Another giant snake story!</strong></em> So,
			Jupiter had to turn my mother into a quail to give birth to me and my sister, Diana. After I was born, I
			wanted to find that python and take revenge on it! Only four days old, I gathered up my bow and golden
			arrows, <em><span class="glossary">quas meus avunculus Vulcanus pro me fecerat</span></em>, and I went searching for the
			python.
			<em><strong>Take that, Mercury; you are not the only strong little baby god!</strong></em> I found the
			python in his cave and shot my arrows at it. It put up a good fight at first, hissing at me loudly and
			trying to swallow me, but it was no match for Baby Apollo! I killed it! And it Iet out the loudest scream
			this side of Parnassus. Then I picked up my lyre and strummed beautiful notes on it as my victory song. I
			slay all day!

				<h3><em>Cogitemus!</em></h3>
				<p>After slaying the giant python, Apollo founded the Pythian Games, which were part of the Greek
					Panhellenic
					Games that are still celebrated today! The Pythian Games included competitions for art and dance,
					naturally.
				</p>
				<p>Why do you think so many Roman gods are portrayed as being courageous and strong as little babies?
