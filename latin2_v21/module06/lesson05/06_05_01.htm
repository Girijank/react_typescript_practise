      <p> Every patron needs his crew—those artists whom he supports and who
        produce great works of art for him and the nation! In Rome, Maecenas
        was the best patron in the biz! He had the greatest writers in his
        crew: Horace, Vergil, Propertius, Varius, and even Augustus for that
        matter. He had a keen eye for talent. </p>
      <p> It’s important to always surround yourself with the best people and
        best talent. So, if you were an aspiring patron and knew that you
        wanted the right crew of artists to showcase to the world and who
        would help you build clout as an artistic patron, whom would you
        choose? Here’s your chance to draft a crew composed of artists from
        both ancient Rome and from the modern day to design one dream patron
        posse! </p>

    <h4>My Dream Circle of Artists</h4>
    <p> It’s patron posse draft day, and I am selecting the perfect artists to
      be members of my crew. There are a few poets whom I’ve been eyeing
      around Rome. I’ve heard their speeches in the <em>Forum Romanum;</em> I’ve listened to bards recite their lyrics
      around town; I’ve read selections of their works at my luxurious villa
      in Apulia. I’m selecting four artists who are innovative, inspiring,
      ingenious, and who I, as their patron, will help make household names
      in Rome. </p>
    <p> <strong>Gallus </strong> has been writing the most transformational
      love elegies, a new poetic genre that I believe will take Rome by
      storm. If I get him in my crew, then I can recruit other poets like
      Varrus, Propertius, and Tibullus who could mimic his style and craft
      poetry, the likes of which Rome has never seen. Then, we will be our
      own supportive network, our own private club of the most
      intellectually bold artists, capable of infusing Greek Alexandrian
      poetic stylistic nuances into our own individualized and personalized
      Roman flavor to write poetry the Romans are yearning for. <em><strong><u>Scio Gallum magnam gratiam apud futuros scriptiones Horatii et
      Vergilii tenturum esse. </u></strong></em> </p>
    <p> Then there’s <strong>Catullus</strong>. You see Catullus has me
      thinking about finding the one—that special lady, like his Lesbia,
      about whom I’d even compose elegiac couplets. Catullus is most
      awe-inspiring, but between you and me, I also think he needs some new
      friends to hang out with. </p>
    <p> Then, here’s the dark horse no one sees coming. I’m selecting the
      biographer <strong>Cornelius Nepos</strong> to my crew. <strong><em><u>Romani sentiebant Nepotem modo poeticae Catulli et Galli non
      scripsisse.</u></em></strong> However, I need someone to provide in-depth research about the times
      in which we live, because to me, that’s what will bring gravitas to
      the verses of Catullus and Gallus. In turn, Nepos will be inspired to
      be more whimsical in his biographical works. Catullus might even one
      day dedicate his poems to him. </p>
    <p> Now for my future artist pick. I have just the perfect lyricist,
      musician, performer, and all around ingénue to join my
      crew—<strong>Prince</strong>! The majestic purple one, who hails from
      the future city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, with his funky musical
      style, heart-piercing lyrics, and mind-mesmerizing sound, will round
      out our collective artistic rhythm. Known for his performances, Prince
      will also teach my artists how to have their audiences hanging onto
      their every word. </p>
    <p> I can see it now! My circle of artists will perform at every festival,
      contest, and country villa. There’s no stopping us! <strong><em><u> Sperabo me patronum divitissimum esse.</u></em></strong> </p>
    <h5 class="mt-2">Latin Sentences</h5>
    <p> Sentence 1: <strong><em><u>Scio Gallum magnam gratiam apud futuros scriptiones Horatii et
      Vergilii tenturum esse. </u></em></strong> </p>
    <p class="arrowTD-padding"> &#x27A4; I know that Gallus will have great influence on the future writings of Horace and Vergil. </p>
    <p> Sentence 2: <strong><em><u>Romani sentiebant Nepotem modo poeticae Catulli et Galli non
      scripsisse. </u></em></strong> </p>

    <p class="arrowTD-padding"> &#x27A4; I shall hope that I am the richest patron! </p>
