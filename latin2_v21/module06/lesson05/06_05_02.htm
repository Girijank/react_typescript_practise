		<h4 class="mt-2">Step 1: </h4>
		<p>Review what you learned in previous lessons about the role of the patron in ancient Rome as well as the Roman
			authors. Then, select members to your circle of artists. You will choose three Roman artists you’d like to
			belong to your patron posse. You will also select one modern artist of your choice to belong to your ancient
			posse whom you think would make your ancient posse even better. </p>

		<h4 class="mt-2">Roman Artists</h4>
		<p>Choose three artists from the list below:</p>
		<ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">

			<li>Lucretius</li>

		<h4 class="mt-2">Step 2:</h4>
		<p>Write your patron posse report. Utilize your research within previous lessons and the research you conducted
			on your own. You can use the sample report, “<strong>My Dream Circle of Artists</strong>” as a creative guide.
			Be sure to include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Write the report in English, in 400&ndash;450 words, using the details from your research chart (see step 1). </li>
			<li>Use three sentences, written in Latin, embedded into your story. See step 3 below for Latin sentence specific
				guidelines. </li>
			<li>Give a citation of the sources you used for your research, using the MLA format.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="mt-2">Step 3:</h4>
		<p>Latin Writing Assignment: Supply the three sentences in Latin from your narrative, along with their English
			translations. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>One sentence must contain an <strong>indirect statement with a present tense main “sensory” verb</strong>.</li>
			<li>One sentence must contain an <strong>indirect statement with an imperfect/perfect tense main “sensory” verb</strong>.</li>
			<li>One sentence must contain an <strong> indirect statement with a future tense main “sensory” verb</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
