    <p>Roman music, poetry, and oration were at first heavily influenced by the Greeks. The Greeks' rich
      lyrical history led to a focus in its educational system on music and the liberal arts. "Mousike" was considered
      all areas influenced by the muses, not just music. History, poetry, drama, dance, and even comedy were considered
      worthwhile pursuits in a Greek school. The idea that an individual needed these aspects of education to be
      considered civilized and well-educated was not one shared by the Romans. While the study of Greek literature
      continued throughout the Roman education system, the other facets of "mousike" were considered too Greek and not
      practical enough for Roman students. </p>

        <p>Another focus of Greek education was the pursuit of a healthy and aesthetically beautiful body through the
          study of athletics. To the Greeks, athletic competition was the height of importance for a young person's
          education, and the sport itself was seen as a beneficial use of time. The Romans, on the other hand, only
          encouraged exercise as a means to an end—sustaining an army of able-bodied soldiers. </p>

        <p>At one point, Roman education became so distanced from the methodology of Greek academics that in 92 BCE,
          the Senate expelled many teachers from Rome out of concern that the teaching of Greek philosophy was
          encouraging disobedience in Roman youth, who, through their study of the Greek arts, were becoming "too
          clever." </p>
