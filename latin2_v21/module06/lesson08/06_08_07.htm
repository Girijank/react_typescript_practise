				<p>Now let’s recall our poetry and oration lessons to celebrate this art form, as I most thoroughly do on Mt.
					Olympus!</p>

		<p>Many Roman poets and orators often conflicted in their viewpoints. Although they contributed to the artistic
			palate within Rome, they often found themselves at conflict with what they wrote. Catullus was not a fan of Julius
			Caesar or the corruption of the Roman Republic. Vergil held both pro and anti-sentiments about the Augustan
			program and wanted his greatest work, the <em>Aeneid</em>, to be burned. Ovid was exiled from Rome because of his love
			poems. Cicero, a once staunch supporter of the Republic, was later killed by one of the Republic’s greatest
			leaders. </p>

		<p>Their works, though, lived on generations afterwards. Renaissance writers loved Roman elegy. Students today love
			reading the stories of Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>. We write poems and songs today inspired by the works of the
			Roman poets. As you continue on in your studies, remember that these poets and orators helped pave the way for so
			many literary works of our age, and they contributed greatly to our modern society. </p>

		<p>We hope that the Romans have inspired you to be a creative thinker and writer and that you continue to study
			Latin well into your future, so Latin can continue to inspire you!</p>
