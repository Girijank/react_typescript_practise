        <p>Have you ever been to a poetry slam? If you think about it, this is a poet orating his or her poetry in
          front of an audience. This sounds like Roman oration! Better yet, it is a great hybrid between the art of
          Roman poetry and the performance of Roman oratory. </p>
        <p>This is the perfect time to practice your poetic and oratorical skills by translating works of the greatest
          Roman writers. Utilize these translations to help prepare you for your end of course assessments, and let
          them inspire you as you progress through your Latin studies and throughout your life!</p>
