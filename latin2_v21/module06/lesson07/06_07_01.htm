    <p class="mb-2">Think of the best public speakers you have watched on video or listened to on the radio. Do they
      inspire you when they speak? Why are their words so powerful? In Rome, students were trained to be public
      speakers, or orators. Being a great orator was a prized skill, as it helped you move up the <em>cursus
        honorum</em>. If you spoke well, you could be a changemaker in the Senate, with “fans” around town supporting
      your opinions. On the other hand, being well-spoken and outspoken also had the potential at times to make you
      public enemy number one.</p>

    <p class="mt-2">The Romans modeled their oratory methodologies after the Greeks, who were specifically trained at
      Athens and Rhodes in oratory technique. By the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE, Rome had fully embraced the art of
      rhetoric. The primary purpose of oration was (and still is) to persuade the audience to your point of view. For
      Romans, one’s effectiveness as a public speaker directly affected public and political life. If an individual was
      good at oral debates in the Senate, he was allowed to speak earlier than others in debates, and his speaking
      skills would bolster his influence amongst senators. </p>
