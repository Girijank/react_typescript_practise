    <h1>Cicero</h1>

    <p>Rome’s leading rhetorician and orator was a “novus homo” by the name of Marcus Tullius Cicero. He was a lawyer,
      senator, writer, and trained orator. Born in 106 BCE, he had lived through the first and second Civil Wars, the
      unraveling of the Republic, and he lived one year past the assassination of Julius Caesar. He rose up the
      <em>cursus honorum </em>to become consul of Rome. He wrote many importantly transformational speeches and books
      during his lifetime.

              <p>Cicero was a famous Roman orator in the time of the Republic.</p>
              <p>He wrote many books on philosophy and also many letters (which survive) to his friends.</p>
              <p>He once gave a speech to defend a man named Sextus Roscius Amerinus who was accused of the murder of
                his father.</p>
              <p>The Romans thought patricide was a most horrible crime, and they gave it a special punishment.</p>
              <p>A man who kills his father is placed in a sack with a monkey, dog, snake, and chicken, and then the
                sack is thrown into the sea.</p>
              <p>The judges did not find guilt for Roscius because of Cicero’s strong defense, which we are able to
                read even now.</p>
              <p>Cicero was a strong lover of the Republic and of the laws, and he fought with Pompey against Caesar.
              </p>
              <p>Marc Antony cut off Cicero’s head and hands and placed them on a spike as punishment.</p>
