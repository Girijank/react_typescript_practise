    <h2>Liberty for Slaves&mdash;Text Version</h2>
    <hr aria-hidden="true">

    <p>
      <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_1">Slavery is mean because it tramples on the feeble and weak.</span>
      A man
      comes with his affidavits from the South and hurries me before a
      commissioner; upon that evidence <em>ex parte</em> and alone, <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_2">he
        hitches me to the car of slavery and trails my womanhood in the
        dust.</span> <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_3">I stand at the threshold of the Supreme Court and
        ask for
        justice, simple justice. <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_5">Upon my tortured heart is thrown the
          mocking words, “You are a negro; you have no rights which white men
          are bound to respect”! (loud and long-continued applause) Had it
          been my lot to have lived beneath the Crescent instead of the Cross,
          had injustice and violence been heaped upon my head as a Mohammedan
          woman, as a member of a common faith, I might have demanded justice
          and been listened to by the Pasha, the Bey or the Vizier;</span> but when I
        come here to ask for justice, they tell me, “We have no higher law
        than the Constitution.”</span> (applause)
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will not dwell on the dark side of the picture. <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_4">God is on the
        side of freedom; and any cause that has God on its side, I care not
        how much it may be trampled upon, how much it may be trailed in the
        dust, is sure to triumph. The message of Jesus Christ is on the side
        of freedom</span>, “I come to preach deliverance to the captives, the
      opening of the prison doors to them that are bound.” The truest and
      noblest hearts in the land are on the side of freedom. They may be
      hissed at by slavery’s minions, their names cast out as evil, their
      characters branded with fanaticism, but Oh, “to side with Truth is
      noble when we share her humble crust. Ere the cause brings fame and
      profit, and it’s prosperous to be just.”
    </p>
    <p>
      May I not, in conclusion, ask every honest, noble heart, every
      seeker after truth and justice, if they will not also be on the side
      of freedom? <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_6">Will you not resolve that you will abate neither heart
        nor hope till you hear the death knell of human bondage sounded, and
        over the black ocean of slavery shall be heard a song, more exulting
        than the song of Miriam when it floated o’er Egypt’s dark sea, the
        requiem of Egypt’s ruined hosts and the anthem of the deliverance of
        Israel’s captive people?</span> (great applause)
