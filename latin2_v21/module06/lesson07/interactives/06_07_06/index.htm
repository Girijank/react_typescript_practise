				<h3>Liberty for Slaves</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_1"><strong>Slavery is mean because it tramples on the feeble and weak.</strong></span>
					A man
					comes with his affidavits from the South and hurries me before a
					commissioner; upon that evidence <em>ex parte</em> and alone, <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_2"><strong>he
						hitches me to the car of slavery and trails my womanhood in the
						dust.</strong></span> <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_3"><strong>I stand at the threshold of the Supreme Court and
						ask for
						justice, simple justice. <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_5">Upon my tortured heart is thrown the
							mocking words, “You are a negro; you have no rights which white men
							are bound to respect”! (loud and long-continued applause) Had it
							been my lot to have lived beneath the Crescent instead of the Cross,
							had injustice and violence been heaped upon my head as a Mohammedan
							woman, as a member of a common faith, I might have demanded justice
							and been listened to by the Pasha, the Bey or the Vizier;</span> but when I
						come here to ask for justice, they tell me, “We have no higher law
						than the Constitution.”</strong></span> (applause)
				</p>
				<p>
					But I will not dwell on the dark side of the picture. <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_4"><strong>God is on the
						side of freedom; and any cause that has God on its side, I care not
						how much it may be trampled upon, how much it may be trailed in the
						dust, is sure to triumph. The message of Jesus Christ is on the side
						of freedom</strong></span>, “I come to preach deliverance to the captives, the
					opening of the prison doors to them that are bound.” The truest and
					noblest hearts in the land are on the side of freedom. They may be
					hissed at by slavery’s minions, their names cast out as evil, their
					characters branded with fanaticism, but Oh, “to side with Truth is
					noble when we share her humble crust. Ere the cause brings fame and
					profit, and it’s prosperous to be just.”
				</p>
				<p>
					May I not, in conclusion, ask every honest, noble heart, every
					seeker after truth and justice, if they will not also be on the side
					of freedom? <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_6"><strong>Will you not resolve that you will abate neither heart
						nor hope till you hear the death knell of human bondage sounded, and
						over the black ocean of slavery shall be heard a song, more exulting
						than the song of Miriam when it floated o’er Egypt’s dark sea, the
						requiem of Egypt’s ruined hosts and the anthem of the deliverance of
						Israel’s captive people?</strong></span> (great applause)
				</p>

				<!-- <p><span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_4">Against the deceit, fraud, robberies, arson, murder,
						slave-raiding, and general policy of cruelty of
						your Majesty’s Government to the natives, stands their record of unexampled patience,
						long-suffering
						and forgiving spirit, which put the boasted civilisation and professed religion of your
						Majesty’s
						Government to the blush. During thirteen years only one white man has lost his life by the hands
						of
						the natives, and only two white men have been killed in the Congo. Major Barttelot was shot by a
						Zanzibar soldier, and the captain of a Belgian trading-boat was the victim of his own rash and
						unjust treatment of a native chief.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_3">All the crimes perpetrated in the Congo have been done in
						your name, and you must answer at the bar
						of Public Sentiment for the misgovernment of a people, whose lives and fortunes were entrusted
						to
						you by the august Conference of Berlin, 1884—1885.</span> <span class="displaypopup" data-id="btn_2">I now
						appeal to the Powers which committed this
						infant State to your Majesty’s charge, and to the great States which gave it international
						being;
						and whose majestic law you have scorned and trampled upon, to call and create an International
						Commission to investigate the charges herein preferred in the name of Humanity, Commerce,
						<span class="tooltip"
