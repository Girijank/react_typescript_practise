        <h4><em>“Liberty for Slaves.”</em> Frances Ellen Watkins Delivered in 1857</h4>
        <p>
          Slavery is mean because it tramples on the feeble and weak. A man
          comes with his affidavits from the South and hurries me before a
          commissioner; upon that evidence <em>ex parte</em> and alone, he
          hitches me to the car of slavery and trails my womanhood in the
          dust. I stand at the threshold of the Supreme Court and ask for
          justice, simple justice. Upon my tortured heart is thrown the
          mocking words, “You are a negro; you have no rights which white men
          are bound to respect”! (loud and long-continued applause) Had it
          been my lot to have lived beneath the Crescent instead of the Cross,
          had injustice and violence been heaped upon my head as a Mohammedan
          woman, as a member of a common faith, I might have demanded justice
          and been listened to by the Pasha, the Bey or the Vizier; but when I
          come here to ask for justice, they tell me, “We have no higher law
          than the Constitution.” (applause)
        </p>
        <p>
          But I will not dwell on the dark side of the picture. God is on the
          side of freedom; and any cause that has God on its side, I care not
          how much it may be trampled upon, how much it may be trailed in the
          dust, is sure to triumph. The message of Jesus Christ is on the side
          of freedom, “I come to preach deliverance to the captives, the
          opening of the prison doors to them that are bound.” The truest and
          noblest hearts in the land are on the side of freedom. They may be
          hissed at by slavery’s minions, their names cast out as evil, their
          characters branded with fanaticism, but Oh, “to side with Truth is
          noble when we share her humble crust. Ere the cause brings fame and
          profit, and it’s prosperous to be just.”
        </p>
        <p>
          May I not, in conclusion, ask every honest, noble heart, every
          seeker after truth and justice, if they will not also be on the side
          of freedom? Will you not resolve that you will abate neither heart
          nor hope till you hear the death knell of human bondage sounded, and
          over the black ocean of slavery shall be heard a song, more exulting
          than the song of Miriam when it floated o’er Egypt’s dark sea, the
          requiem of Egypt’s ruined hosts and the anthem of the deliverance of
          Israel’s captive people? (great applause)
