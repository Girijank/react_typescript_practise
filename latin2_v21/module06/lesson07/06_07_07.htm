    <h1>Modern Roman Oration?</h1>

    <p> You have now read Roman speeches and a modern day speech that both utilize oratorical and grammatical stylistic
      concepts to craft the effectiveness of the speech. Let’s see if these modern era great public speakers have
      followed the oratorical techniques of the Romans! </p>
    <p> In your note guide, fill in the Roman oratorical characteristics you see in each speech. </p>

        <p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is known as one of the greatest orators of the modern era. Let’s see how much he
          leans upon the Roman oratorical method. </p>
        <p>Excerpt from <strong>“I’ve Been to the Mountaintop”</strong>. Delivered 1968 in Memphis Tennessee.</p>
       
          <p>
            Something is happening in Memphis; something is happening in our
            world. And you know, if I were standing at the beginning of time,
            with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view
            of the whole of human history up to now, and the Almighty said to
            me, "Martin Luther King, which age would you like to live in?" I
            would take my mental flight by Egypt, and I would watch God's
            children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt
            through, or rather across the Red Sea, through the wilderness on
            toward the promised land. And in spite of its magnificence, I
            wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus. And I
            would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides, and Aristophanes
            assembled around the Parthenon. And I would watch them around the
            Parthenon, as they discussed the great and eternal issues of
            reality. But I wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would go on, even to the great heyday of the Roman Empire. And I
            would see developments around there through various emperors and
            leaders. But I wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would even come up to the day of the Renaissance and get a quick
            picture of all that the Renaissance did for the cultural and
            aesthetic life of man. But I wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would even go by the way that the man for whom I am named had his
            habitat. And I would watch Martin Luther as he tacked his
            ninety-five theses on the door at the church of Wittenberg. But I
            wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would come on up even to 1863, and watch a vacillating president
            by the name of Abraham Lincoln finally come to the conclusion that
            he had to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. But I wouldn't stop
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would even come up to the early thirties and see a man grappling
            with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation. And come with an
            eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but "fear itself." But I
            wouldn't stop there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strangely enough, I would turn to the Almighty and say, "If you
            allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the 20th
            century, I will be happy."
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that's a strange statement to make, because the world is all
            messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land, confusion all
            around. That's a strange statement. But I know, somehow, that only
            when it is dark enough, can you see the stars. And I see God working
            in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men, in some
            strange way, are responding.
          </p>

        <p> Elie Wiesel, author. Delivered in 1999. <strong>“The Perils of Indifference.”</strong> </p>
        
        <p>
          Fifty-four years ago to the day, a young Jewish boy from a small town in the Carpathian Mountains woke up,
          not far from Goethe's beloved Weimar, in a place of eternal infamy called Buchenwald. He was finally free,
          but there was no joy in his heart. He thought there never would be again. Liberated a day earlier by
          American soldiers, he remembers their rage at what they saw. And even if he lives to be a very old man, he
          will always be grateful to them for that rage and also for their compassion. Though he did not understand
          their language, their eyes told him what he needed to know—that they, too, would remember and bear witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I stand before you, Mr. President—Commander-in-Chief of the army that freed me and tens of
          thousands of others—and I am filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the American people.
          "Gratitude" is a word that I cherish. Gratitude is what defines the humanity of the human being. And I am
          grateful to you, Hillary, or Mrs. Clinton, for what you said and for what you are doing for children in the
          world, for the homeless, for the victims of injustice, the victims of destiny and society. And I thank all
          of you for being here.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are on the threshold of a new century, a new millennium. What will the legacy of this vanishing century
          be? How will it be remembered in the new millennium? Surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in both
          moral and metaphysical terms. These failures have cast a dark shadow over humanity: two World Wars,
          countless civil wars, the senseless chain of assassinations (Gandhi, the Kennedys, Martin Luther King,
          Sadat, Rabin), bloodbaths in Cambodia and Algeria, India and Pakistan, Ireland and Rwanda, Eritrea and
          Ethiopia, Sarajevo and Kosovo; the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima. And, on a different
          level, of course, Auschwitz and Treblinka. So much violence; so much indifference.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is indifference? Etymologically, the word means "no difference." A strange and unnatural state in which
          the lines blur between light and darkness, dusk and dawn, crime and punishment, cruelty and compassion, good
          and evil. What are its courses and inescapable consequences? Is it a philosophy? Is there a philosophy of
          indifference conceivable? Can one possibly view indifference as a virtue? Is it necessary at times to
          practice it simply to keep one's sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the world
          around us experiences harrowing upheavals?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, indifference can be tempting—more than that—seductive. It is so much easier to look away from
          victims. It is so much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work, our dreams, our hopes. It is,
          after all, awkward, troublesome, to be involved in another person's pain and despair. Yet, for the person
          who is indifferent, his or her neighbors are of no consequence. And, therefore, their lives are meaningless.
          Their hidden or even visible anguish is of no interest. Indifference reduces the other to an abstraction.
