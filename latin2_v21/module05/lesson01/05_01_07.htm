        <p><em>“He (Augustus) beautified a city not adorned for the majesty of the empire and exposed to flooding and fires so much so that he could rightly boast that he left it a city of marble, which he received as a city of bricks.” Suetonius, Augustus 28</em></p>

          <p>Augustus ruled as Roman emperor from 19 BCE to his death in 14 CE.  During his reign, Rome would become the city that we marvel at today, a city of great wonder, inspiration, larger-than-life monuments, temples, and buildings.  Rome would expand its borders far beyond any ruler had before him, and far beyond any other Mediterranean city ever could.  Rome would call the best writers, artists, and philosophers into the city to craft illustrious narratives about its founding and history. This was because of Augustus. </p>
          <p>Augustus crafted Rome’s image to reflect a nation of hope, solidarity, abundance, and glory.  By the time of his death, Augustus had turned the imagery of Rome from a city struggling for power within and externally, to a city of wonder and of the greatest esteem.  Rome would become Rome, the Eternal City.</p>

          <p><strong>Calculated and Crafted</strong></p>
          <p>It was all a well-constructed, calculated plan.  Augustus would transform Rome into the capital of the world, while he would transform his image into the man predestined to lead Rome into its glorious transformation.  It’s called  <em><strong>propaganda</strong></em>.  Augustus developed probably the most well-orchestrated propaganda machine the world has ever seen.  </p>

          <p><strong>His propaganda agenda: </strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>To promote himself as the god-like “savior of the city”</li>
            <li>To create a “golden age” for Rome in its infrastructure, artwork, expansionism, and political restructuring </li>
            <li>To boost his popularity and have total buy-in from the Roman people so he could push his agenda and power even further  </li>
            <li>To use his <em>auctoritas</em>, his ultimate control, charisma, personal power to craft a Roman society to his liking</li>
            <li>To create a period of peace after the Civil Wars and entitle this period the <em><span class="glossary">Pax Romana</span></em></li>
          </ol>

          <p><em>Let’s learn how his propaganda machine worked!</em></p>

                    <p> Augustus ushered in a new artistic style of marble statues, portraits, cameos, glassware, frescoes, paintings, and reliefs, designed to highlight his lineage, youth, bravery, and god-like imagery. Augustus rebuilt a city full of energy and excitement that evoked <em><span class="glossary">pietas</span></em> and <em><span class="glossary">publica magnificentia</span></em> for all of Rome’s accomplishments and for promotion of himself and his family as the leaders of the Golden Age of Rome.  </p>

                    <p>Mythology served as a powerful tool for propaganda.  Augustus crafted statues, portraits, and coinage of him either looking like the god Apollo or crafting imagery ofhim with Aeneas, Romulus, and Venus to make the people believe he was like a god and descended from a god. As <em><span class="glossary">Pontifex Maximus</span></em>, Augustus reorganized or founded new priesthoods. He was a devoted servant in his position as priest and he showed his piety through religiously focused artwork, coinage, temples, and altars.  He also created more religious festivals and celebrations.</p>
