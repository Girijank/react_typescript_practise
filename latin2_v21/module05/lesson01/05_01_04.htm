      <h1>Call Me Caesar Augustus!</h1>
      <p>
        Julius Caesar’s adopted son, Octavian, was ambitious, smart, confident,
        handsome, youthful, and ready to rule the world! In his twenties he had
        already defeated Antony, celebrated three triumphs, and was given the
        <em><span class="glossary">praenomen Imperator</span></em> by his
        soldiers. Although at first a mediocre military commander at best, after
        the Battle of Actium and then after seizing Egypt and a series of
        smaller battles, Octavian held undisputed control of the Roman world.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time Octavian was age 36 in <strong>27 BCE</strong>, the Roman
        Senate had bestowed upon him a new name of “Augustus,” meaning “most
        revered one, holy, dignified” and had given him ultimate power in Rome.
        He then adopted the name of Caesar and was called thereafter Caesar
        Augustus. Imperator. Emperor.
        <strong
          >Augustus had just managed to become Rome’s first ever Roman
          emperor!</strong
        >
        How did he do it?
      </p>

                    <tr><td><strong>Step 3:</strong> Claim that you have “restored the Republic” because you have eliminated its enemies and given power back to the Senate.</td></tr>

                      <td><strong>Step 4:</strong> Be the Roman <em>consul</em> every year beginning in 31 BCE to 23 BCE. Then, step down from this position and say it’s because it is very unrepublican of you to be <em>Consul </em> every year.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 5:</strong> Say you will rule Rome as co-equal with your naval commander, Agrippa, even though you still hold all control.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 6:</strong> Make a carefully staged statement in the Senate that you are giving all authority back to the Senate and the Roman people.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 7:</strong> Make the Senate believe they have full power again, but use your
                      <em><span class="glossary">auctoritas</span></em> or personal
                      “influence” to sway their decisions so you get what you want.
                      But, still respect the Senate.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 8:</strong> Allow the Senate to let you keep your command as governor of
                      your foreign provinces and give you
                      <em><span class="glossary">Maius imperium</span></em>, a title

                    <tr>
                      <td><strong>Step 10:</strong> Never be known as Imperator in public; only allow people to call
                      you Princeps or “first man.”</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 11:</strong> Internally, know that you are actually Imperator and act that
                      way.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 12:</strong> Go abroad for three years, give up your <em>consulship</em>, and make it
                      seem like you have abdicated your role for the Senate to have
                      power. In this way, the people will riot in your favor and love
                      you.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 13:</strong> Create a catchy name for your reign, the
                      <em><span class="glossary">Pax Romana</span></em
                      >. It will give the illusion that Rome is a wonderfully peaceful
                      place to live.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 14:</strong> Craft a lofty agenda of expansion, public artworks, monuments,
                      buildings, and literature, and say it is all for the “glory of
                      Rome.” Know that it is really for the “glory of Augustus.”</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 15:</strong> Get the best writers and poets to write flattering poems about
                      you and say you are descended from Romulus, Aeneas, and Venus.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Step 16:</strong> Create yourself in the image of the Apollo and eventually get the people to call you <em>Deus</em>.</td></tr>

                  Easy, right? This is the path that Caesar Augustus followed to
                  become the most revered, most beloved, most productive, and
                  first ever emperor of Rome. As a result, Rome entered into its
                  third and final governmental phase of the classical
                  period&mdash;<strong>the Roman Empire</strong>.
