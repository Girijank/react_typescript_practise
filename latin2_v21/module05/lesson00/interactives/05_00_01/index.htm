                <p>I am often depicted as a young, yet fierce woman—a testimony to the dual attributes of beauty and
                  strength reflected in the women of Rome. You can often identify me by my bow and quiver of arrows, as
                  I am always on the hunt. In Greek mythology, I am known as Artemis. In Etruscan mythology, I am
                  Artume. </p>

                <p>As the goddess who watches over all women, I am often depicted in association with the moon and its
                  cycles. There are also many stories of me related to the constellations—including the famous Orion's
                  belt, which you will learn more about in the coming lessons.</p>

                <p>Most images place me in my favored domain—nature. I am also the protector of animals, and I have been
                  known to act with swift vengeance when my familiars are threatened or hurt. Both the dogs of the hunt
                  and prey such as deer are symbols of my realm. </p>
