		<h1>Speaking Latin Everywhere!  </h1>
		<p>As Rome took over the Mediterranean world, so did its Latin language! You might have a picture now of how the languages of many European countries come from Latin.  If Romans were setting up provinces everywhere and having their Latin-speaking troops live in these provinces, then Latin was being infused with the native languages of these provinces.  Pretty soon, Latin-based blended languages would be developed from these provinces, and these languages became the Romance Languages!  </p>

		<p>Latin is almost unique in its regularity of forms and the size of its vocabulary.  For example, the Oxford English Dictionary, the standard for an English dictionary, runs 20 very large volumes with very small print and contains about 600,000 words.  A very good Latin dictionary, The Oxford Latin Dictionary, only contains about 39,500 words and is in a single, normal-sized volume.  </p>
	
		<p>Because of its regularity and <strong><span class="glossary">parsimonious</span></strong>  vocabulary, it is an ideal trade language between groups with different languages. Trade languages are simplified languages that allow for trade across cultures through simple communication. Swahili and New Guinea Pidgin are two examples of trade languages used today!
