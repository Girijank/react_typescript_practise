                After Commodus was murdered, a coup d’état took place in Rome where many fought for the seat of power. Septimius Severus would rise up to become emperor! He was an African from Libya, a member of the land aristocracy as so many other Africans had been.  For centuries, Rome had relied upon the engineering and artistic skills of African nations and black people to build the Empire, such as the stone cutters from Nubia and Ethiopia, the master builders of Malta and Crete, and the wisdom from the scientists and philosophers from Alexandria. Thus, <strong>Septimius Severus</strong> becoming Rome’s first black emperor was a natural progression for the Romans.

                I, Septimius Severus, am the Roman emperor, and I am from Africa! Libya, precisely. My father was a Roman knight, so I come from a family of Roman citizens.  I married Domna, a Syrian woman, whose name in Arabic means “black.”  I am smart—a lawyer, a Senator by age 18, and a great military commander. My Muurish friends from Niger and North Africa, Laetinus and Clodius Albinus who were respected military commanders and Praetorian Guards, plotted to kill Commodus.  After the death of Commodus, our group was ready to take charge in Rome. <em><span class="glossary">Africani regentes Romam, ita!</span></em>, But I wanted solo power, so I had those involved in Commodus’s assassination killed; then I got rid of the Praetorian Guard.  I let my friend Clodius co-consul with me at first.
