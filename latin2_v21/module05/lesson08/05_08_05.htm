      <h1>Africans in Rome</h1>

      <p>
        Italy was a country of immigrants. Before the Roman rule, North Africans
        had immigrated into Italy and helped build the Etruscan empire. The
        Romans called the Africans, Muurs. Other Muurs, or Black people, were aboriginal to Europe or descended into Italy from all over Africa,
        including Egypt, Moracco, Nigeria, Nubia, and Libya to name a few
        places. They maintained shrines and priesthoods throughout the Empire
        and had their own shadow military army. Depicted on Trajan’s Column,
        you’ll see images of the Muurish calvary with their braided hair
        fighting with the Romans in Dacia.

            Who were the Muurs? They were people from the north African province
            of <strong>Maur</strong>etania (modern-day Morocco and Algeria).
            Classical literature notes that they revolted against the Roman
            Empire in 24 CE. Over the centuries, the Moors had invaded European
            countries and Spain, which came under Moorish control in the
            beginning of the 700s CE. Their name is derived from the Latin term
            <em>maurs.</em> In medieval times, the name transformed into
            <em
              >moro (French), maure (Portuguese), maur (Romanian), moors
              (English).</em
            >
            The name then became more closely associated with Muslim people, and
            during the Crusades it had a derogatory meaning of “infidel.”
