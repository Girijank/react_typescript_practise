            <h4>The Coliseum</h4>
            <p>If you ever get the opportunity to go to Rome, you will probably want to see the Coliseum. It is one of the most well-known tourist spots in Rome and is located near the Forum. The movies have added to the luster of the amphitheater as seen in <em>Gladiator, Roman Holiday, and The Lizzie McGuire Movie.</em> Construction on the Coliseum began in 72 CE under Emperor Vespasian. It was completed in 80 CE during the reign of Emperor Titus. It is estimated that the Coliseum could hold more than 50,000 people. During the public spectacles, spectators could see gladiator fights and other events. Roman engineering was advanced enough to flood the floor of the Coliseum for mock sea battles. The Coliseum, along with aqueducts and the Pantheon, represents the architectural high points of Roman imperial engineering.</p>

                <li>Have you identified the case, number, and gender for the nouns and adjectives?</li>
                <li>Do your English definitions for each of the words in the Latin translation match the
                  definitions found in the toolbox dictionary?</li>
                <li>Have you double-checked your Latin versus English word order?
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>HINT</strong>:  In Latin, adjectives follow the nouns they modify, genitive nouns follow
                      the nouns they possess, and verbs are typically found at the end of the
                      sentence. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Did you transfer all punctuation from Latin to English?</li>
