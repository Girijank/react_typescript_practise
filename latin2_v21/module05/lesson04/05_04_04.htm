            by the people and marry Marcia Furnilla, and then have a
            relationship with Bernice, the Queen of Judaea. But my reign was

            Then, a fire in Rome broke out for three days straight; after

            I fled to my family’s villa in the Sabine Hills and died there.
            What I am most proud of is completing the Flavian Amphitheatre,

                  Vespasian began construction on this wonder around 70 CE. It

                  around 80 CE. With its commencement, Titus held 100 days of
                  games for the Roman people. Today, it is one of the seven
                  wonders of the world.

                  In August of 79 CE, Mt. Vesuvius, located in the Gulf of
                  Naples, Italy, erupted. Its volcanic smoke and ash plumed over
                  the neighboring city of Pompeii, suffocating its residents.
                  Within 24 hours, all but 2,000 residents had perished as a
                  result of the eruption. The volcanic ash preserved the ruins
                  of the city, making it a remarkable archaeological and tourist
                  site today.

                  engulfed by Mt. Vesuvius’s gaseous fumes and ravaging mud

                  Herculaneum was located farther away than Pompeii from the
