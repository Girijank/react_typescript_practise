    <h1>The Julio–Claudian Imperial Dynasty </h1>

    <h4>
      <span class="t1"><em>'In the time of Augustus, she [Livia] possessed the greatest influence, and she always
          declared that it was she who had made Tiberius emperor; consequently, she was not satisfied to rule in equal
          terms with him, but wished to take precedence over him.'</em> <span
          class="small grey-text text-darken-3">(Cassius Dio, <em>Historiae Romanae</em>, book. 57, ch. 12, sec. 3)</span></span>
    </h4>
    <p class="mt-2">Augustus needed an heir to carry on his seat as emperor, but he did not have a son to pass it to.
      Thus, he turned to his adopted sons, the sons of his wife Livia, to become the next emperors of Rome. This was his
      succession plan. Each <em><span class="glossary">Imperator</span></em> would adopt the surname Caesar and continue
      to rule Rome with absolute power. </p>

                  of the renowned Claudii family. <em><span class="glossary">Maximam partem vitae meae egi</span></em> on foreign military exploits where
                  I was an outstanding general. I also held tribunal power in Rome. I never wanted to be the emperor,
                  but my step-father, Augustus Caesar, made me divorce my wife, Agrippina, marry his daughter, Julia,
                  and become his “next-of-kin” to the emperor’s seat. Augustus adopted me at the age of 40, and <em><span class="glossary">mea mater, Livia, erat gravissima</span></em> about placing me as his successor. I understood the importance of
                  keeping order and stability in Rome, and I was a fine administrator. However, I never developed a good
                  relationship with the Senate nor the people, and I was distrustful of many, especially my nephew and
                  adopted son, Germanicus, whom the people really wanted to rule. Some believe I had him poisoned. His
                  death did give way to my son, Drusus, as my successor. However, I retreated in 23 BCE to the island of
                  Capri to self-isolate with my Praetorian Guard. I sent in my pal, Sejanus, to rule Rome while I was
                  away. But he made a fatal mistake; he had an affair with my son Drusus’s wife, poisoned Drusus, and
                  then married my son’s wife. Then, he announced that he was the Roman emperor. No! So, I went back to
                  Rome, had him accused of treason in the Senate, and had him murdered.

                  gave power back to the Senate, I built roads, and I threw plenty of games for the entertainment of the
                  people. But, within the year of my ascendency, I fell ill, perhaps to a brain disease, and after that
                  I was nasty, mean, vicious, and terrifying. I killed several of my Praetorian Guards; I would
                  humiliate people in public, or have men killed just because. I then began dressing like the gods while
                  roaming the streets of Rome and then performing as an actor, singer, charioteer—you name it! I even
                  made my sister a goddess. I had become unhinged. <em><span class="glossary">Tum omnia haec parva bella in Gallia et Brittania gesseram</span></em> just for the fun of it. Then, I had gold statues built of
                  me in Rome and throughout the Empire. The people had had enough of me, and so my Praetorian Guard
                  assassinated me. Ahh man!
