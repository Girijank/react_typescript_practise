    <h1>Perfect Passive Participle (PPP)</h1>
     <p>Now, let’s dig deep into our next participial form! You’ll love this one. Hint: You already know it!!</p>

     <ul>
       <li><strong>Latin Form</strong>: It is the 4th principal part of the verb.</li>
       <li><strong>Declined</strong>: It is declined like the adjective magnus, -a, -um.</li>
       <li><strong>Agreement</strong>: It agrees, like a regular adjective, with the noun or pronoun it modifies in case, number, and gender.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>example: oppidum <em>occupatum</em></strong> = the town having been <em>seized</em> = Nominative (or Accusative) singular neuter</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>

					<h3 class="text-center mt-1"><strong>Nota bene</strong>: Do you recall that you have already been using the 4<sup>th</sup> principal part of the verb for the Perfect Passive tense, the Pluperfect Passive tense, and the Future Perfect Passive tense?

    <p>We must treat participles with care and understand how they function in a sentence. Participles can function as adjectives or as nouns in a sentence. Let’s see how this works.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="black white-text"><p><strong>Perfect Passive Participle as Adjectives</strong></p></td>
          
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>When functioning as an adjective, the participle will describe the noun. You will decide whether to translate the participle before the noun it modifies or after the noun it modifies. You will choose the correct translation based upon what makes best sense in the sentence.</p>

        data-caption="Cookie heart, having been broken" data-width="300" />
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><p class="mt-2"><strong>Example </strong>: The girl’s heart,<strong> having been broken</strong> after losing the baking contest, became full again when she ate a delicious cookie.</p>
            <p><strong>Participle <em>: having been broken</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Participle Explanation </strong>: Which heart? The heart which was <strong>broken</strong>. <em>Verbal Adjective Nota bene</em>: See how the <strong>broken</strong> is both a verb action, while at the same time describing the girl’s heart.</p></td>
