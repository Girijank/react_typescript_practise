      <p>
        I am Diana, goddess of the hunt, daughter of Jupiter and Leto. I am a child of nature and love, roaming through
        the woods with my nymphs. One day, with my nymphs in a grove sacred to me, I decided to bathe in a spring near a
        grassy bank. But I was startled. I heard my nymphs yelling in high-pitched voices and then saw them beating
        their chests. They were trying to warn me that a stranger had entered my sacred grove.<em><span class="glossary">Id tardius erat</span></em>.I stood there, undressed, towering over my nymphs and a hunter—Actaeon was his name—who had seen me! Embarrassed and angry, I threw water in his face. Then, I had no
        choice—I turned him into a deer. <em><span class="glossary">Quid facere debui?</span></em> I couldn’t risk him
        telling anyone he saw me, the goddess Diana, unclothed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now the deer, Actaeon, ran away, but he was chased by his hunting dogs—all three of them! <em><span
            class="glossary">Eum cinxerunt et eum assiluerunt</span></em>.Then, his fellow hunters gave chase and joined
        in this hunt. Oh, what have I caused! Actaeon was gravely wounded by his own dogs and fellow hunters. But it is
        important for mortals to know to never spy on a goddess!
