    <p>The Roman Empire had begun! Emperors ruled Rome from the reign of Augustus until the fall of the Western Roman
      Empire in 476 CE. The emperor had <em><span class="glossary">auctoritas</span></em> and the ability to control the
      <em>senatus populusque</em> Romanus on his own. The Senate was respected, but in name only and no longer held much power
      over the state in the way it had during the Roman Republic. In fact, the Senate had given Augustus and his
      successors (unknowingly) <em><span class="glossary">imperium maius</span></em>over the provincial governor, who
      had <em><span class="glossary">tribunica potestas</span></em> and the authority to create, pass, and veto laws. As
      a result, Augustus was able to bring stability and peace to Rome. However, Rome was now in the hands of an emperor
      and would remain so for centuries to come. </p>

    <h3>I am Emperor!</h3>
    <p>Augustus would appoint a member of his extended family to be his successor as emperor. This would carry on, for the most part, as the tradition for how an emperor would be would be chosen thereafter. The new emperors would assume the
      title of Caesar Augustus as their common name—to show their imperial ties to Augustus—and retain his power and
      right to rule. </p>

    <p>As you might have guessed, this type of familial passing of power at times was a nightmare for Rome. Many
      emperors were consumed by their power and ruled Rome in a tyrannical fashion. </p>
