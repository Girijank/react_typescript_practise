    <h1>Rome and its Provinces</h1>

    <p class="mt-2">When Augustus and his successors held military campaigns throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa, they
      would leave members of their military legions behind in the conquered areas to set up colonies. These areas became
      properties of Rome known as <span class="glossary">provinces</span>. A <span class="glossary">peace treaty</span>
      was signed between the conquered land and Rome, giving Rome control over land boundaries, taxes, and
      administrative structure. Although each province was self-administered by its local magistrates, the emperor
      appointed a governor or representative of the emperor to carry out the province’s administrative duties. </p>
    <h3>A True Empire</h3>
    <p>The Roman Empire consisted of the city of Rome and all of the cities and countries throughout the Mediterranean
      world that it had conquered and made into provinces. By the 2<sup>nd</sup> c. CE, Rome had 50 to 60 million
      inhabitants living in its provinces and thousands of kilometers of borders to defend, due to its expansion
      efforts. The Roman Empire was colossal, and it developed an operating manual to which many world Empires to come
      would follow.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Conquer and control as much land as possible.</li>
      <li>Subjugate and exploit the people of the conquered land.</li>
      <li>Extract resources from the conquered land to increase Rome’s wealth.</li>
      <li>Make the province reliant upon Rome for protection against threats.</li>
      <li>Provide urbanization to the province.</li>
      <li>Collect revenue, taxes, and subsidies from the province as a money-making income stream.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Co-Dependency</h3>
    <p>
      Rome and its provinces had a co-dependent relationship. Rome, of course, was the more dominant figure in this
      relationship, but let’s learn how each supported one another!

        <p>Think about the territories and regions which the United States controls outside of its continental fifty
          states. Then, think about if it exhibits any of the imperialistic traits which Rome utilized to gain power,
          land mass, and dominance. Even without the title, would you consider the United States an empire?</p>
