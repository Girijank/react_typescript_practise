					<p> I, Nero, at age 17 became emperor of Rome! At first, I was great at it! I followed the lead of my tutors,
						the Stoic philosopher Seneca and the Guard Burrus, who made great relationships with the Senate on my
						behalf. <em><span class="glossary">Etiam meam Agrippinam ex Roma removere me adiuvaverunt</span></em>. Then,
						after five years, I changed for the worse—and there was no coming back for me! I just wanted to have fun
						without any supervision! So, I poisoned my stepbrother, planned to have my mother assassinated, and made
						Seneca take his own life. <em><span class="glossary">Me amante mores Graecos</span></em>, I held Greek
						festivals and performed all over town as a singer and actor. I was great, too! I murdered my wife, Octavia,
						daughter of Claudius. I perhaps set Rome on fire in 64 CE which nearly destroyed all of Rome. Luckily for
						me, I could just rebuild Rome into whatever I wanted after that, without those other monuments in my way.
						So, I built my <em><span class="glossary">Domus Aurea</span></em>, widened the streets of Rome, and rebuilt
						our infrastructure. I would say the fire gave Rome new life! However, others blamed me for it and as a
						result, tried to kill me or rebel against me. I could not take the blame anymore and shortly after that, I
						took my own life.

					<p>Nero devised many plans to have his mother assassinated, but she continued to outwit him. First, he planned
						to have her bedchamber ceiling fall on her as she slept, but that didn’t work. Then, he sent her out on the
						ocean in a collapsible boat. But she was able to swim to shore. Then, he finally had his men kill her with
						daggers, which haunted him for the rest of his life. </p>
