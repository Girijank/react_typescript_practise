				<p>Let’s listen to this story about the goddess Diana and her friend, Orion.</p>

					<p class="mt-1">Orion was a dear friend of mine. In fact, he was one of the finest hunters I had ever known,
						which is
						why this story breaks my heart. For days on end, we would hunt together, conduct foot races against
						one another, and challenge each other to even greater heights in our sport. At night, we would
						reveal our innermost truths by campfire. <em><span class="glossary">Probiter, non amicum amiciorem Orione tenui</span></em>. But, this friendship, unfortunately, was fated for ruin, and I
						blame my twin brother, Apollo, for its demise!</p>

				<p>Now, let’s hear Apollo's side of the story.</p>
				<div class="p-1 border-light">

					<p class="mt-1">Sorry, dear sister, but Orion has got to go! You see, Orion is getting a bit too close to you. <em><span class="glossary">Amatne is tecum?</span></em> You need to concentrate on your godly duties, and not on your friendship with him. Also, I want Orion to be my friend only—not yours!</p>
					<p>Sadly, Orion rejected my friendship, which made me quite angry. So, I took revenge upon him. While he was sleeping, I sent a menacing dream to him—that a giant scorpion would sting him in his heart. And when he woke up and stepped outside, I had a giant scorpion waiting to strike him! Orion bravely fought the scorpion, but he could not pierce its armor. While fighting, the scorpion pushed Orion into the sea. Score point for you, scorpion!</p>
				</div>
				<p class="mt-1">Apollo told his sister that one of her nymphs had been attacked by a man named Opus and that
					Opus had
					jumped into the sea to escape. After hearing the news, Diana swiftly grabbed her bow and arrow, set
					out for the sea, and shot “Opus” dead in the water. Whoopsie! </p>

This man is not Opus, it’s—oh my, oh my—Orion. <em><span class="glossary">Meus amicus mortuus est et mea culpa est.</span></em> Oh Orion, I shall honor our never-ending friendship, our bond, and our partnership. I will set you amongst the stars where you shall shine brightly for eternity. I will also place the scorpion in the stars, right behind you, to remind people to always be true to their feelings.</p>

					<li>Science and math in Latin? <em><strong>Betelgeuse</strong></em>, the bright red star in Orion’s
						shoulder is about 640 light years from earth. In contrast, Bellatrix, the other shoulder star,
						is only 200 light years from earth, three times closer. Mintaka, the rightmost star in the belt,
						is a whopping 1200 light years away from the earth, twice as far as
						<em><strong>Betelgeuse</strong></em>.</li>
