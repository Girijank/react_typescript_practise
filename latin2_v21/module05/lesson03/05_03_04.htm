		<h1>Future Active Participles</h1>

		<p>Let’s learn another participial form—the future Active participle, that is!</p>

		<h4 class="mt-2">Future Active Participle English Translation:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>It denotes action that is about to happen. </li>
			<li>It is translated as “about to verb” or “going to.”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In English, the future Active participle will only be utilized in an adjectival form. </p>

								<p> <strong>Future Active Participle as Adjective</strong> </p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<p>When functioning as an adjective, the participle will describe the noun. You will decide whether to
									translate the participle before the noun it modifies or after the noun it modifies. You will choose
									the correct translation based upon what makes best sense in the sentence.</p>
