    <p>With Nero dead, the family line ceased to exist. Nero did not appoint a successor, and thus everyone wanted and
      fought for the throne. As a result, in 69 CE, Rome had four emperors in one year. They were Galba, Otho,
      Vitellius, and Vespasian. </p>
    <p>We, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian, all ruled Rome as <em>Imperator</em> in 69 CE.</p>
