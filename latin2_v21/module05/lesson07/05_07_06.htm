				<p>I, Trajan, from the Spanish province of Italica, am now the first Roman emperor from a province! After Augustus, I am probably Rome’s best emperor.  <em><span class="glossary">Ut filius praesidis Romani, momentum militum cognovi</span></em>, so before I came to Rome to accept my position as emperor, I was conquering Upper Germany for a year. When I arrived in Rome, the people, the Senate, and the army loved me, but I made sure never to be called <em><span class="glossary">dominus</span></em> but rather <em ><span class="glossary">Optimus Princeps</span></em>. I increased the size of the army and distributed money and grain to the people.  My biggest accomplishment was my success in the Dacian Wars, defeating the people of Transylvania who had troubled Rome since the Republic. From this, we enjoyed huge spoils—money and slaves. The money helped expand our building program. I built Trajan’s Column and Trajan’s Marketplace in Rome. Then, I annexed Dacia and kept going—annexing Arabia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, and the Persian Gulf. I expanded our boundaries far beyond what any other emperor had ever done.  Unfortunately, this also led to the people of Egypt, Cyprus, Judaea, and others to revolt against me. However, I consider myself one of Rome’s greatest emperors!</p>

		<h3>Trajan’s Forum</h3>

		<p>Designed by his architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, the Emperor’s Forum was a massive complex built to commemorate Trajan’s victories in the Dacian Wars. It included a bronze statue of Trajan, the Basilica Ulpia, Trajan’s Column, Trajan’s Marketplace, a library, and public open spaces. Let’s view the Forum!</p>

					<p>Trajan gave the title of Augusta to his beloved sister, Marcia. She was the first sister of an emperor to have been granted this title. Marcia travelled with Trajan, helping him make important decisions for the empire throughout the provinces. After her death, she was deified by the Senate.</p>
