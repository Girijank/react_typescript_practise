				<p>I, Nerva, only ruled Rome for two years as emperor. I was greatly needed in Rome after the horrible Domitian.  At first, I was able to stabilize our economy. I was very good to the Senate and to the people. For example, <em><span class="glossary">populo pecuniam dedi</span></em> to buy land, and I instituted a child-support program. <em><span class="glossary">Autem, potestatem exercituum tenere non potui</span></em>, which led to a revolt by the Praetorian Guard. Before my natural death, I adopted a man from southern Spain named Trajan.  I gave him the title of Caesar and appointed him as my successor, which was probably my biggest claim to fame.</p>
