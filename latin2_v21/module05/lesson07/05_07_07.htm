        <p>I, Hadrian, am another one of the good emperors…I think. I loved everything about the Roman Empire and
          wanted to soak in all of its wonders. So, I traveled extensively throughout the empire, studying it, writing
          poetry, and meeting troops and people from every walk of life. As emperor, I made sure that we were at peace,
          that we had better infrastructure, that we expanded our borders, that we trained our military, and that there
          was a great appreciation for Rome. During my reign, there were perhaps 50–70 million people living in the
          empire. Life was great—we had antibiotics, refrigeration, heating, and cooling on the streets and in our
          homes. My biggest blunder was my mishandling of the Jewish revolts, which caused me to retreat into isolation.
          But, before I died, I made sure to have a succession plan, <em><span class="glossary">legens proximas duas aetates imperatorum</span></em>.

    <h3>Hadrian’s Wall</h3>
    <p>Empires in the ancient world were in the business of building walls to protect their interests from invaders. One
      example is the Great Wall of China. Rome was also in the business of building walls. One of the architectural
      achievements of the Roman Empire was Hadrian’s Wall. After the expansionist policies of Trajan, Hadrian wanted
      peace and stability in the empire. Hadrian visited Britain in 122 CE, and he decided to build a 73-mile wall
      between Britain and Scotland. He wanted the wall to defend Roman interests in Britannia as well as control
      immigration and trade. Today, Hadrian’s Wall is a UNESCO historic site and can be visited by tourists.</p>
