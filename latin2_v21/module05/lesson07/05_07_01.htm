        <p>When Rome created their provinces, they expected these foreign inhabitants to incorporate Roman standards and
          customs into their daily lives with a process of assimilation. However, Rome did not always grant the same
          rights or freedom to its provincial residents as it did to its own citizens. What types of freedom, rights,
          and upward mobility an inhabitant had depended on what type of province he lived in. There were three types of
          provinces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Roman colonies and <span class="glossary">municipia</span></li>
          <li>The Latin colonies and municipia</li>
          <li>The non-Roman towns, including (a) free towns, allied and non-allied, and (b) tributary or stipendiary
            towns</li>

            it as a special gift or from one who already had it. </td>
          <td>The chief burdens on the provinces were both militaristic and financial. The provinces had to constantly
            supply men to the Roman army, and they were also responsible for heavily taxing their residents so they
            could pay tribute to the imperial city. The Romans exploited the inhabitants of their provinces by forcing
            them to become Rome’s major labor force to help expand the empire. </td>

              <li>To appease native tribes to help Rome defend itself, Rome would often bribe native tribes in their

        <p><strong>Burdens on the provincial resident</strong></p>

        <p>
          The worst part is that, as a non-citizen, you didn’t have much protection, and so you could not defend
          yourself legally against any punishments handed to you. You could be executed easily. Non-Roman citizens were
          often crucified in public or forced to fight to the death in gladiatorial games as their capital punishment.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3"><strong>Did all provinces comply?</strong></p>

        <p>Non-Roman towns maintained their own system of government, outside of Roman administration. Thus, many towns
          did not assimilate. Instead, they operated under their own selected leadership, maintained their own laws, and
          sustained their own local customs. This would cause conflict between Rome and a province. Here are some
          examples:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It took Rome nearly 200 years to subdue Spain. </li>
          <li>There were numerous revolts in Jerusalem against Rome. About 1 million Jews had died during Titus’s reign.
          </li>
          <li>The Romans were brutal towards those cities that rebelled against becoming a province. They would conduct
            public executions and plunder them to force them into submission. <strong>Remember the Boudica
              rebellion?</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Think about the phrase, "history is bound to repeat itself." What similarities do you see between the process
          of enculturation and assimilation required by the Romans onto their provinces and that of the techniques of
          European colonization of Africa and the Americas? </p>
