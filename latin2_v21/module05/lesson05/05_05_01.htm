		<h4>Natural Resources</h4>
		<p>The Romans exploited natural resources (land, mineral and ores, agricultural and water sources) from each of
			the provinces they controlled. They developed technology specifically for extraction and used human labor
			for the extraction. The Romans overmined salt from the province of Asia, ore from the quarries of Egypt,
			grain, vegetables and olives of the Maghreb region of North Africa, and gold from gold mines of northern
			Spain to help support Rome’s elite troops and its widespread empire. </p>
		<p>These acts caused great damage and destruction to the provinces' environment and ecology. For example, Rome’s
			overexploitation of timber caused such widespread deforestation that the imperial lands experienced heavy
			erosion. This decreased the quality of the soil, causing the food supply to dwindle. Historians believe this
			might have been one of the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. <em>If only the Romans had
				realized that protecting the environment, instead of destroying it, could have saved their civilization!
			</em></p>
		<p>Here’s your chance to write a letter to a Roman emperor challenging him to be an eco-warrior for the good of
			Rome!</p>

			<h4>Sample Letter: “Save our Forests!”</h4>
			<p>Dear Emperor Otho,</p>
			<p>Salve. I believe your time as emperor will be brief, so let me get straight to the point. If you want to
				truly make a name for yourself this year, be the emperor who protects our forests and the one who is a
				champion for those of us who care about our lands. </p>
			<p>I live in the Roman province of northern Gaul, and I know that our forest trees are being cut down to be
				used for building Rome’s housing structures, building our massive war fleets, and heating Rome’s baths
				and public facilities. I understand that wood is essential for our mining and smelting purposes so we
				can have necessary resources such as salt, iron, copper, and gold… and for padding the pockets of the
				nobles. </p>
			<p>However, I must tell you that Rome’s excessive mining production is causing devastation to our forests.
				In fact, since wood is constantly needed for the furnaces and smelters at each mining area, our forests
				are disappearing at alarming rates. Not only is this happening here in northern Gaul, but my friends in
				other provinces tell me their forests are nearly depleted as well. The clearing of our land has
				decreased the nutrients of our topsoil so much that we are now concerned that our harvesting yields will
				actually diminish because our land is becoming increasingly infertile. </p>
			<p>Because of deforestation, I am afraid that we will see more floods, causing our coastlines, rivers, and
				water supplies to change. I am afraid that our birds and forest animals will lose their homes, and we
				will run out of food for future generations. I am afraid that our wonderful Roman Empire will crumble
				like those before it, all because we did not take care of our forests. Other civilizations have seen
				their lands destroyed by deforestation. Remember the wise Plato in the 5th century BCE even said, “The
				loss of timber had denuded the hills and plains surrounding Athens and caused massive soil erosion.”
				Let’s not be like the Greeks and witness our civilization whittle away because of deforestation! How
				about when you cut down a tree, you plant one in its place? Let’s together save our trees and save Rome,
				Otho! </p>
			<p>Here are three ways, Otho, I believe you can be of immediate help:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Te Imperatore in LXIX C.E., legem servantem silvas nostras statua! </em>(With you as emperor in
					69 CE, establish a law protecting our forests!)</li>
				<li><em>Oppidis conditis, avibus in arboribus benignitatem monstrare incolis oportet. </em>(After the
					towns have been established, it is necessary for the inhabitants to show kindness to the birds in
					the trees.)</li>
				<li><em> Es ferox, Otho, et es imperator, qui futuro nostro spem perpetuam creaturus est. </em>(Be
					courageous, Otho, and be the emperor, who is about to create lasting hope for our future. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>Gratias Imperatori,</em></p>
			<p>Lucilius</p>
			<p> Martius I, LXIX C.E. </p>
		</div>
		<p class="mt-2">Your mission… to help save one of Rome’s provinces from environmental doom. You will write a
			letter to a Roman emperor about your concerns regarding overexploitation of natural resources from a
			specific province and make suggestions for how to save it. </p>
