					<td>Remember:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>You will use the chart to write your letter. </li>
							<li>Filling in the chart requires independent research as well as knowledge from your lessons. Don't forget that all sources must be cited!</li>
						</ul>

							<li>Your letter must contain a greeting to your chosen emperor and closing signature.</li>
							<li>This letter is to the emperor—make sure you address him directly!</li>
						</ul>

					<td><strong>Step 3:</strong> Write three sentences in Latin at the end of your letter telling the emperor how he can help your cause.    </td>
					<td>Remember:<br>
						<p>You will be writing three sentences in Latin. </p>
					<ul>
						
						<li><strong>One</strong> must contain a  <strong>present Active participle</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>One</strong> must contain <strong>an Ablative Absolute, using a perfect Passive participle</strong>. </li>
						<li><strong>One</strong> must contain a <strong>future Active participle</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>One of the three sentences</strong>  must contain a <strong>time frame</strong> of when the action must be completed.</li>
					</ul>
						<p>	Your sentences should be simple and short, reflecting your level of Latin proficiency. Provide English translations with these Latin sentences below your story narrative.
