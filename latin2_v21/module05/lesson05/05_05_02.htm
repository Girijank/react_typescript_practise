		<p><strong>Step 1: </strong> </p>
		<p>Choose one of Rome’s provinces in the Roman Empire, and conduct research on its natural resources. Then, write a letter to one of the Roman emperors about the over-exploitation of the resource and the environmental effects it has on your province. </p>
		<p><strong>Choose a province its natural resource Rome overexploited from the list below:   </strong></p>	  
		<ul class="list-decorative-checkbox">
			<li>Spain:  Gold </li>
			<li>Romania: Salt</li>
			<li>Egypt: Stone Quarries</li>
			<li>Northern Africa: Grain, Legumes, and Olives</li>
			<li>Roman Britain: Rural Wetlands</li>
			<li>Greece (example: Laurian mines):  Silver </li>	
			<li>Portugal (example: ancient city of Ammaia): Silver and Copper</li>	
			<li>Syria, India, or Africa: Exotic Animals</li>

		<p class="mt-2"><strong>Step 2:</strong>
		<p>Write your letter to the emperor. Utilize the research you conducted on your own about the province and its natural resources, as well as the information about the emperors and provinces from this module's lessons.  You can use the sample letter, “<strong>Save our Forests!</strong>” as a creative guide. Be sure to include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Write a full letter in <strong>English</strong>, in 300 to 400 words, using the details from your research chart (see step 1). Write a salutation to the emperor you chose, and close your letter with your Latin name. (You can make one up—be creative!) </li>
			<li>Use three sentences written in Latin at the end of your letter. See Step 3 below, for Latin sentence specific guidelines.  </li>
			<li>Give a citation of the sources you used for your research, using MLA format.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Step 3: </strong> </p>
		<p>Latin Writing Assignment:  Supply the three sentences in Latin from your letter, along with their English translations. </p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>One</strong> sentence must contain a <strong>present Active participle</strong>. </li>
			<li><strong>One</strong> sentence must contain and  <strong>an Ablative Absolute, using a perfect Passive participle</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>One</strong> sentence must contain <strong> a future Active participle</strong>.</li>
			<li>Nota bene: <strong>One of the three sentences</strong> must include a <strong>deadline</strong> for when Rome must complete your requested demand.</li>
		</ul>
            <p>Example: “<strong>Save our Forests!</strong>”</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sentence 1: <em>Te Imperatore in <strong> LXIX CE</strong>, legem <strong>servantem</strong> silvas nostras statua!</em> = <strong>present Active participle. Also, it contains a deadline</strong>. </li>
			<li>Sentence 2: <em><strong>Oppidis conditis</strong>, avibus in arboribus benignitatem et monstrare incolis oportet</em>. <strong>It contains an Ablative Absolute, using a perfect Passive participle</strong>.</li>
			<li>Sentence 3: <em>Es ferox, Otho, et es imperator, qui future nostro spem perpetuam <strong>creaturus est</strong></em>. = <strong>future Active participle</strong>. </li>

			  <h3>Diana’s Directive: Composing, Using Participles in Latin</h3>
			  <!-- <p class="mb-0">Writing a sentence in Latin using relative pronouns may seem tricky, 
			  but it all depends on your approach! Visit your Toolbox for a step-by-step guide to 
			  Composing with Relative Clauses in Latin.</p> -->
			  <p class="mb-0">Writing sentences in English versus Latin are two very different processes! Use these steps for   <a href="../../global/toolbox/content/latin2/module05/050502_composing_using_participles.htm" class="modal-pop" data-mwidth="90%" data-mheight="90%"><strong> Composing, Using Participles</strong></a> to guide your writing. These guides can always be found in your Toolbox for anytime you need composition help!</p>
			 
			  <p class="mt-1">When writing in Latin, one challenge many scholars face is the declining of Roman names. Since names are nouns and can be used as such in a sentence, make sure they have the correct case endings! You can find a refresher on Latin Name Declining in your <a href="../../global/toolbox/toolbox_01.htm" target="_blank">Toolbox</a> </p>
