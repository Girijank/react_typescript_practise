        <p>It's time to prepare for your <strong>Discussion-Based Assessment&mdash;DBA</strong>. </p>
        <p>Now you know more about the first Roman emperors and the beginning of the official Roman Empire. You also learned how to translate the present Active, perfect Passive, and future Active tense participles and how to use the Ablative Absolute.</p>
        <p>Now, it’s time to get ready to discuss these topics with your instructor. Talking about (and in) a foreign language can make even the most veteran speakers nervous sometimes! Use this lesson to practice on your own before your discussion assessment—the more you speak, the more at ease you will feel. Time to dust off this "ancient" language, and give it a whirl! </p>
        <p>Remember, to help you do well for your DBA, use these practices as much as needed before you contact your teacher.</p>
