            <h4>The Conversion of Constantine </h4>
            <p>Should religion have anything to do with politics?  Or to put another way, should politics have anything to do with religion?  If you live in America or the western world, you might say no.  But in the history of the world, that is a relatively new opinion.  For most of history, religion and politics have mixed in one form or another.  In the Roman world, there was a change because Christianity became the established religion of the Roman Empire.  For a long time, Christians were persecuted by the Roman authorities because Christians refused to worship the emperor.  But over time, many in Rome sympathized with the Christians and their plight in society. </p>
            <p>The real change in imperial policy came with the Emperor Constantine who converted to Christianity. Constantine was in a fight to become emperor. After Emperor Diocletian divided the Roman Empire, Rome had two emperors.  Due to succession problems, there were several men who wanted the title of emperor.  The battle came down to Constantine and Maxentius. </p>
            <p>Translate the following passage about Constantine and Maxentius. You will submit your work to your instructor for a grade. Make sure to use the Useful Tips!</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>	Have you identified the tense, voice, person, number, and mood of the verb?</li>
                  <li>	Have you identified the case, number, and gender for the nouns and adjectives?</li>
                  <li>Do your English definitions for each of the words in the Latin translation match the definitions found in the toolbox dictionary?</li>
                  <li>	Have you double-checked your Latin versus English word order?
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>HINT</strong>: In Latin, adjectives follow the nouns they modify, Genitive nouns follow the nouns they possess, and verbs are typically found at the end of the sentence.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Did you transfer all punctuation from Latin to English?</li>
