          <p>Have you heard the catchy tune called “Istanbul” from the 1950s by the group, the “Four Lads”?  It was also covered by the group, “They Might be Giants” in 1990. In the song, they repeat the name <em>Constantinople</em> throughout.  You might not have known that the city of Constantinople or its modern name, Istanbul, located in modern-day Turkey, was created by the Roman Emperor, Constantine!  </p>

        <p>[Verse 1]<br>
          Istanbul was Constantinople<br>
          Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople<br>
          Been a long time gone, Constantinople<br>
          Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night<br>
          Every gal in Constantinople<br>
          Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople<br>
          So if you've a date in Constantinople<br>
          She'll be waiting in Istanbul<br>

            People just liked it better that way<br>

            No, you can't go back to Constantinople<br>
            Been a long time gone, Constantinople<br>
            Why did Constantinople get the works?<br>
            That's nobody's business but the Turks<br>

          <audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_constantineintro_culture.mp3"></audio>
          <p>I, Constantine, was a revolutionary Roman emperor! In the beginning of my career, I campaigned fiercely in Britain, Africa, Sicily, and Sardinia and gained great support of my military who helped me eventually become <em>imperator</em>. <em><span class="glossary">Ut imperator Romae, in Roma habere non volui quod urbs in ruinas ceciderat</span></em>. So, I went to the old city of Byzantium, decided to rebuild this city with great monuments and architecture, and named the city Constantinople after myself! Fitting!  My mother was a devout Christian, and so I had a great understanding of the Christian faith and I recognized Christ as God.  I began a Christian church building program, and I started to build basilicas in Rome where the Pope could be seated. I also marked the burial sites of martyrs around the Empire with churches, including the Church of St. Peter next to the Tiber river. My building program helped Rome’s architectural structure be designed with Christ in mind. I was baptized on my deathbed. You should call me Constantine the Great!</p>

          <h4>Christian Emperors</h4>
          <p>Following Constantine, many of the Roman emperors practiced the Christian faith and recognized the seat of the Bishop as a powerful leader in Rome. Although Rome was still the major city in the Empire, Constantinople served as the Christian capital of the Roman Empire.
