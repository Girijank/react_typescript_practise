        One of the turning points in the history of Rome was the emperor Constantine’s acceptance of Christianity. Constantine (280 CE–337 CE) was trying to gain control of the Roman Empire after the breakup of the tetrarchy. However, his brother-in-law, Maxentius, had seized Italy and Rome.

      In his efforts to consolidate his power in 312 CE, Constantine waged a battle with Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge over the Tiber River. There, Constantine had a religious experience. He had a vision of the Greek letters Chi and Rho—the first two letters in the Greek rendering of the name of Christ.  He also heard a voice which said, <em>"<span class="glossary">in hoc signo vinces</span></em>.” Because of his vision, Constantine believed he was destined to defeat Maxentius. He placed the symbol of the cross on his soldiers’ shields and heavily defeated Maxentius. Constantine won the battle, and Christianity became an accepted religion in the Roman Empire.  In 313 CE, he published the Edict of Milan which made Christianity a tolerated faith, and Christians were able to recover losses from the persecutions.

        Now, religious leaders played a greater role in state affairs, and the state was hardly separated from religion. Constantine called church councils, such as the Council of Nicaea, which settled a doctrinal dispute in the church over the deity of Christ.  Another accomplishment of Constantine was the building of the city of Constantinople in modern-day Turkey to be a “New Rome.”  This shifted political power to the eastern portion of the Roman Empire.

        The lasting influence of Constantine can be seen in the eastern Roman Empire, based in Constantinople, which survived long after the fall of the western Roman Empire and preserved Roman culture, although with a Greek flavor.  Finally, Christianity played a vital role, not only in the Roman Empire, but well into the Middle Ages in Europe due to Constantine protecting it.  Europe was known as Corpus Christianum—the body of Christ.
