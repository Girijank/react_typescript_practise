		<h1>A Changing Empire </h1>

		<p>Many more rulers ruled Rome as imperator. There were many more wars, internal civil conflicts, and crises the
			Romans had endured as well. There were 18 emperors who ruled in the mid-3rd century CE. Invasions by the
			Germans, revolts in Africa, and instability in Roman leadership will all change the composition of the Roman
			Empire and its operation. </p>

		<p>The glory days of Rome were gone. Rome was now financially unstable, militarily insecure, and politically
			weak. Then, there was the rise of Christianity, a religion with which the Emperor Diocletian was in
			conflict...

				<p>I, Diocletian, now Roman emperor, will try to bring stability back into Rome after all of the crises we have endured. Our empire is falling apart because it is too large. Thus, I will split the Empire
					into East and West regions. I myself will rule the East, and Maximian, the West.<em><span
							class="glossary">Tum, quisque nostrum virum regere praeter nos leget</span></em>. This will
					be the first time that the Empire is ruled by four people! A <em><span
							class="glossary">tetrarchy</span></em>, if you will. All was well, except I did not like the
					Christians or other minority groups, and so I began a brutal period of persecuting these people. I
					also stripped Christian soldiers and clergy of their rank and enslaved many of them. People called
					this the “Great Persecution,” which caused great strife within the Christian church. I eventually abdicated to retire in the Roman provincial town of Split, Croatia.</p>
