    <p class="mt-2">The moral of this story is: never talk badly about the mother of a goddess. But, that’s exactly what Niobe, the queen of Thebes, did. By the story’s end, you’ll understand why I have warned you.</p>

    <p>Let’s listen to this story about the boastful Niobe and her confrontation with the goddess Diana.</p>
    <audio class="audioBtn" controls src="media/la2_diananiobe_culture.mp3"></audio>

    <p>My mother, Leto, was effervescent, humble, and splendid in every way. <em><span class="glossary">Me et geminum fratrem, Apollonem, in insula Deli peperi</span></em>. The women of Thebes would constantly honor my mother by crowning their heads with laurel and offering incense and prayers to her. Niobe was terribly jealous of Leto and how the people of Thebes loved her so much. After all, Niobe was their queen, not Leto. Yes, Niobe was beautiful, of royal lineage, and rich, but she boasted about her attributes too much. </p>

    <p>Then, one day, Niobe claimed that she was <em><span class="glossary">pulchrior, honestior, et divinior quam Leto</span></em>. Well, Niobe was the daughter of the god Tantalus and the granddaughter of Atlas, while Leto was the daughter of a barely-known Titan god named Coeus. Here’s where it gets worse: Niobe continued to boast that she was better than Leto, even saying that she was a better mother than Leto. I know that Niobe has fourteen children in total—seven sons and seven daughters—but, did she forget that Leto’s two children are two of the most powerful gods on Olympus? Me and Apollo! Niobe, darling, this is not going to turn out well for you.</p>
    <p>When mom came to me and Apollo complaining about Leto’s hubris and insulting comments, we were enraged and immediately jumped into action. We both swiftly grabbed our bows and arrows, descended down to the palace and Thebes, and found Niobe’s children. One by one, Apollo struck down her sons. One by one, I struck down her daughters. As I was about to deliver an arrow into her last daughter, Niobe pleaded with me to spare her. While pleading, Niobe was turned into stone and sent away to her birthplace, Phyrgia, where she was propped on top of a mountain. Rumor has it that tears still trickle down from the marble face of the stone to this day. Go figure. </p>
