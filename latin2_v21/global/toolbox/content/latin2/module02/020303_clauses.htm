    <h2>Clauses Guide</h2>

    <p>A <strong>clause</strong> is a group of words that hang together, anchored by a subject and verb. There are two types of clauses:
        <strong>independent</strong> and <strong>dependent</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Independent Clause:</strong></p>
    <p>An independent clause:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>contains a subject and a verb <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>establishes a complete thought</li>
        <li>can be called a <strong>sentence</strong> all on its own</li>
        <li>can be joined (by a conjunction) to another independent clause
            <ul>
                <li>independent clause + conjunction + independent clause = compound sentence</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Dependent Clause:</strong></p>
    <p>A dependent clause:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>contains a subject and verb <strong>but</strong></li>
        <li>also contains a word that makes it unable to stand alone</li>
        <li><strong>cannot</strong> be called a sentence on its own</li>
        <li>is connected to an independent clause
            <ul>
                <li>independent clause + dependent clause = complex sentence</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Link between a Dependent Clause and an Independent Clause</strong></p>
    <p>The link between a dependent clause and an independent clause is a <strong>subordinating conjunction</strong> or a <strong>relative pronoun</strong>. For example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mercury literally climbed out of his crib
            <strong>when</strong> he was a baby. (when = subordinating conjunction)
        </li>
        <li>The book, <strong>which</strong> your class is reading this week, is the
            <em>Aeneid</em>. (which = relative pronoun)
        </li>
        <li>My best friend Roni,
            <strong>who</strong> was at the bus stop, always played fun games with me. (who = relative pronoun)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>As</strong> I put on my point shoes, my feet began to immediately hurt. (as = subordinating conjunction)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Because</strong> the young girls took swim lessons from Mrs. Allison, they learned how to swim really well. (because = subordinating conjunction)
        </li>
        <li>I always loved to play the Bach double,
            <strong>which</strong> my violin teacher Mrs. Rogers taught me. (which = relaive pronoun)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Relative Clause</strong></p>
    <p>A relative clause </p>
    <ul>
        <li>describes a previous noun
            <ul>
                <li>This previous noun is called the <strong>antecedent</strong> (from the Latin
                    <em>ante + cedere = to go before</em>).
                </li>
			</ul></li>
        <li><strong>starts</strong> with a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which)
            <ul>
                <li>The relative pronoun refers directly to the antecedent (so we use “who/whom/whose” to refer to a person and “which” to refer to a thing).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>is often separated out with commas</li>
        <li>is sometimes called an "adjectival clause" as it acts describes a noun much like an adjective</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Examples using relatives clauses:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The boy, <strong><em>whose</em> book I have</strong>, is a friend.
            <br>
            (The relative clause describes the boy. We use “whose” because “boy” is a person.)
        </li>
        <li>The poem,
            <strong>in which the forest is described,</strong> evokes feelings of calm.<br>
            (The relative clause describes the poem. We use “which” because “poem” is a thing.)
        </li>
        <li>The senator, <strong><em>whom</em> I knew well,</strong> is his father.
            <br>
            (The relative clause describes the senator. We use “whom” because “senator” is a person.)
        </li>
        <li>We discussed the concept of freedom, <strong>which was an important theme in the movie.</strong>
            <br>
            (The relative clause describes freedom. We use “which” because “freedom” is a thing.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <em>Nota bene</em>: In Latin, the relative pronoun <strong>must</strong> match its antecedent in gender and number, but not always case.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Indirect Statement</strong></p>
    <p>An indirect statement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>relays a thought or statement...indirectly (i.e. It’s not a direct quote)</li>
        <li>usually begins with the word “that” in English</li>
	</ul>
        <p>The independent clause, which will introduce an indirect statement, contains a “tell” verb (e.g. tell, know, believe, say, announce, report, proclaim, etc.)</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>I know <em>that the man loves the woman</em>.</p>
    <p>(In this sentence, <em>that is a subordinating conjunction</em> indicating an indirect statement).</p>
    <p><em>Nota bene</em>: In Latin, indirect statement uses an infinitive instead of a dependent clause. You can search <strong>Indirect Statement</strong> in your Toolbox for more on how these statements are formed in Latin!</p>
