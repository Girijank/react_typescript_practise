    <h2>Composing with Relative Clauses in Latin</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to help you write a sentence using a Relative in Latin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write the sentence in English first, using simple grammar.</li>
        <li>Bracket off the independent clause and the relative clause, then treat them as two separate parts, as follows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Part I: Compose the independent clause first:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find the subject of the sentence: Could be a noun <strong>or</strong> a verb<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li><strong>Noun Subject</strong>: Write this subject in the
                    <strong>Nominative</strong> case. Check your noun declining charts for the correct noun form. Example: The
                    <strong>man</strong> loves the woman.
                    <strong>"The man"</strong> is the subject of the sentence and would need to be in the Nominative case.<br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Write the subject as the first word in your composed sentence.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verb Subject</strong>: Check your verb conjugating charts for correct verb form. Example:
                    <strong>We will love</strong> the woman. The pronoun "we" is represented in Latin by the personal ending, -mus in the verb. Therefore, the verb is the subject of the sentence. Note: A
                    <strong>1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup></strong> person verb is
                    <strong>always</strong> the subject of the sentence.<br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Write the verb as the last word in your composed sentence.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Write the verb in Latin, if you haven't done so already. Check your verb conjugating charts for correct verb form.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>If you have a <strong>noun subject</strong>, use 3<sup>rd</sup> singular or 3<sup>rd</sup> plural
                </li>
                <li>If you have a <strong>verb subject</strong>, you already took care of the verb in Step 2.<br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Write the verb as the last word in your composed sentence.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any remaining words: Identify the function of remaining words (Possessor, Indirect Object, Prepositional Phrase, Adverb) and write those words in their correct cases.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>Possessor = Genitive case will follow the word it possesses.</li>
                <li>Indirect Object = Dative case will be written closer to the verb.</li>
                <li>Prepositional Phrase = Accusative or Ablative case following a preposition will need to be written where you'd put it in English.</li>
                <li>Adverbs will be written right before the verb in the sentence.</li>
                <li>If it's a passive voice sentence and contains an Ablative of Agent, then: <br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Identify it and write it in its correct Ablative case and number.
                            <br/>Remember the Ablative of Agent = a/ab + Person in the Ablative case.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Identify your Antecedent. This is the word which the relative clause will describe. Identify it's gender and number.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Part II: Compose the Relative Clause</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Identify your relative pronoun and its function (Subject, Possessor, Indirect Object, Direct Object, Prepositional Phrase). Then, write it in Latin in its corresponding Latin case.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>Match your relative pronoun to the same gender and number of its independent clause antecedent (i.e. the noun that it's referencing)</li>
                <li>Write your relative pronoun next to its antecedent.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Verb of the relative clause: write the verb in its correct tense, voice, person, and number.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>The verb should be the last word in your relative clause</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any remaining words: Identify the function of remaining words (Possessor, Indirect Object, Prepositional Phrase, Adverb) and write those words in their correct cases.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>Possessor = Genitive case will follow the word it possesses.</li>
                <li>Indirect Object = Dative case will be written closer to the verb.</li>
                <li>Prepositional Phrase = Accusative or Ablative case following a preposition will need to be written where you'd put it in English.</li>
                <li>Adverbs will be written right before the verb in the sentence.</li>
                <li>If it's a passive voice sentence and contains an Ablative of Agent, then: <br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Identify it and write it in its correct Ablative case and number. Remember the Ablative of Agent = a/ab + Person in the Ablative case.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Separate the relative clause with commas.</li>

        <em>Nota Bene: Notice how the main verb of the independent clause is located at the end of the entire complex sentence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Sentence structure in Latin is flexible, but you can follow a general layout:</p>
    <p>
    <p>Subject &#8680; indirect object &#8680; direct object &#8680; prepositional phrase(s) &#8680; adverb &#8680; main verb</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every sentence will contain a subject and a verb, but not necessarily all of the other cases/grammar forms.</li>
        <li>Put adjectives after the noun, except if it is a noun of size or quantity.</li>
        <li>Genitives follow the noun they possess/describe.</li>
    </ul>
