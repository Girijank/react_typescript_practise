  <h2>Indirect Statement Tenses&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: Every indirect statement in Latin needs three things: a main verb, an accusative subject, and an infinitive verb. </p>
  <p>Start your translation by determining the tenses of the two verb forms. </p>
  <p>The translation of the infinitive tense depends on the tense of the main verb. </p>
  <p>Think of the infinitive forms as points on a timeline, with present infinitives indicating the same time as the main verb, perfect infinitives indicating time before, and future infinitives indicating time after. </p>
  <p>For example, "<em>Videt canem ossum capere</em>" is translated as "She sees that the dog is seizing the bone." </p>
  <p>Because the main verb, <em>videt</em>, is in the present tense, the present infinitive "<strong><em>capere</em></strong>" is translated at the same time, using "<strong>is seizing</strong>." [On screen: "Videt" is shown on a timeline in present tense with "capere" above it as the present infinitive. "Capere" is circled in the sentence "Videt canem ossum <strong>capere</strong>." "Is seizing" is underlined in the sentence "She sees that the dog is <em>seizing</em> the bone."] </p>
  <p>If we change the infinitive to "<strong>cepisse</strong>" in the perfect tense, our translation changes to show time before&mdash;"the dog had seized the bone." [On screen: "cepisse" in perfect tense is shown on the timeline before "capere". "Cepisse" is circled in "Videt canem ossum cepisse." and "had seized" is underlined in "She sees that the dog <em>had seized</em> the bone.] </p>
  <p>When the verb is changed to the future tense, we see a shift to time after&mdash;"the dog will seize the bone." [On screen: "capturum esse" in future tense is shown on a timeline after "capere". "capturum esse" is circled in "Videt canem ossum <strong>capturum esse</strong>." and "will seize" is underlined in "She sees that the dog will seize the bone."] </p>
  <p>But what happens with a past time main verb? "Vidit canem ossum capere." (She saw that the dog seized the bone.) </p>
  <p>Since our main verb, <em>vidit</em>, is in the perfect tense, the present infinitive is translated at the same time, using "seized." [On screen: "Vidit" is shown on timeline in perfect tense with "capere" above it as the present infinitive. "capere" is circle in the sentence "<em>Vidit canem ossum <strong>capere</strong></em>." and "seized" is underlined in the sentence "She saw that the dog <em>seized</em> the bone."] </p>
  <p>If we change the infinitive to "cepisse" in the perfect tense, our translation changes to show time before&mdash;"the dog had seized the bone." [On screen: "cepisse" in perfect tense is shown on the timeline before "capere". "Cepisse" is circled in "Vidit canem ossum <strong>cepisse</strong>." and "had seized" is underlined in "She saw that the dog <em>had seized</em> the bone.] </p>
  <p>When the verb is changed to the future tense, we see a shift to time after&mdash;"the dog would seize the bone." [On screen: "capturum esse" in future tense is shown on a timeline after "capere". "capturum esse" is circled in "Vidit canem ossum <strong>capturum esse</strong>." and "would seize" is underlined in "She saw that the dog <em>would seize</em> the bone."] </p>
  <p>When it comes to indirect statement tenses, it's all about time. </p>
  <p>And now, it's your time! </p>
