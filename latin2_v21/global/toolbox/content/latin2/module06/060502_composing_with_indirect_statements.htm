        <h2>Composing with Indirect Statements in Latin</h2>

        <p>Follow these steps to help you write a sentence using an Indirect Statement in Latin:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Write the sentence in English first, using simple grammar.</li>
            <li>Bracket off the main sentence and the Accusative–Infinitive clause.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Part I: Compose the Main Sentence:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Find the subject of the sentence: Could be a noun <strong>or</strong> a verb</li>
            <li class="list-unstyled">
                <ol class="lower-alpha">
                    <li><strong>Noun subject</strong>: Write this subject in the <strong>Nominative</strong> case. Check your noun declining charts for the
                        correct noun form. Example: The man loves the woman. “The man” is the subject of the sentence and
                        would need to be in the Nominative case.<br>
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li>Write the subject as the first word in your composed sentence.</li>
                        </ol>                    
                    </li> 
                    <li><strong>Sensory verb subject</strong>: Check your verb conjugating charts for correct verb form. Example: We will love
                        the woman. The pronoun “we” is represented in Latin by the personal ending, -mus in the verb. Therefore,
                        the verb is the subject of the sentence. Note: A 1<sup>st</sup> <strong>or</strong> 2<sup>nd</sup> person verb is <strong>always</strong> the subject of the sentence.<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For these sentences, in English, the verb introducing the adjective-noun clause will be a verb of
                                thinking, knowing, hearing, perceiving, etc., if words are not quoted directly (direct statement), a
                                clause is often introduced by that (indirect statement).<br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For example: <em>He says, "The boys are working."</em> (direct statement) versus He says that the boys
                                        are working. <em>(indirect statement)</em>.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Note that in the second sentence there are two clauses: "He says" (independent clause because it can
                                stand by itself) and "that the boys are working" (dependent clause-makes no sense without the first
                                clause). </li>
                            <li>Some Latin verbs that introduce indirect statement are as follows:

        <p><strong>Part II: Compose the Accusative-Infinitive clause</strong></p>

        <p>To understand indirect statement, you must put four pieces of a puzzle together to get the entire picture. Take each puzzle piece slowly and completely, and then it becomes easy. In this lesson you will do the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Write the subject of the Accusative-Infinitive clause in the Accusative case.</li>
            <li>Write the verb of the Accusative-Infinitive clause in the Infinitive form based upon the following examples.<br>
