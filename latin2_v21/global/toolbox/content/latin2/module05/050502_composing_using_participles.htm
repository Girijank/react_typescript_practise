    <h2>Composing with Participles in Latin</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to help you write a sentence using a participle in Latin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write the sentence in English, using simple grammar.</li>
        <li>Compose these sentences in the same way you would compose a regular Latin sentence. The only difference is that you will insert the participles where they best fit into the sentence. The participle most likely will be placed next to the noun it modifies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Composing a Latin sentence</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find the subject of the sentence.<br/>
            <ol class="upper-alpha">
                <li>The subject can be a noun/pronoun controlling the action in the sentence. Example: <strong>The man, loving the woman,</strong> protects the children. <strong>“The man”</strong> is the subject of the sentence. Write this identified subject in the Nominative case. Check your noun declining charts for the correct noun form.<br/>
                    <ol class="upper-roman">
                        <li>Write the Nominative subject as the first word in your composed sentence.</li>
                        <li>Then, <strong>“loving”</strong> is the present active participle, so match the correct participial form in case, number, and gender to <strong>“the man.”</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>                
            </ol>
            <li>Write this main verb in Latin.  If you haven’t done so already, write the verb to have the correct tense, passive or active voice, person, and number. Check your verb conjugating charts for the correct verb form.<br/>
                <ol class="upper-roman">
                    <li>Write the verb as the last word in your sentence.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Compose any remaining words. Identify the function of remaining words (direct object, possessor, indirect object, prepositional phrase, adverb), and write those words in their correct cases.<br/>
                <ol class="upper-alpha">
                    <li>Possessor = Genitive case will follow the word it possesses.</li>
                    <li>Direct Object = Accusative case</li>
                    <li>Indirect Object = Dative case will be written before the Accusative case.</li>
                    <li>Prepositional Phrase = Accusative or Ablative case following a preposition will need to be written where it best fits in the flow of the sentence.</li>
                    <li>Adverb will be written right before the verb in the sentence.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Participles:</strong> If your participle is not used with your subject, add the participle where it needs to fit in the sentence, next to the noun it modifies.</li>
        <li>Ablative Absolute: <strong>If your participle is part of an ablative absolute,</strong> place the ablative absolute phrase at the beginning of the sentence and write a comma after it. Make sure both the participle and noun are in the Ablative case.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Nota Bene: Sentence structure in Latin is flexible, but you can follow a general layout:  subject, indirect object (if there is one), direct object, prepositional phrase(s), infinitive (if there is one), main verb.   Adjectives are placed after their nouns, except if it’s a noun of size or quantity; Genitives follow the noun they possess/describe.
