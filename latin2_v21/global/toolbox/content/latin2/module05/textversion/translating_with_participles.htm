  <h2>Translating with Participles&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <h3>What is a participle?</h3>
  <p>Announcer: A participle is a verb that does not act like a verb, because it does not have a subject or conjugate based on person. This is called a verbal adjective. </p>
  <p>Like an adjective, a participle declines in order to indicate a noun or pronoun it is describing. </p>
  <p>In English you can often spot a participle based on its "<strong>-ing</strong>" ending. </p>
  <p>[On screen: "Does not have a subject," "Does not have a 'person'," "a verbal adjective" and "ing" is circled in "translated using "<em>ing</em>."] </p>
  <p>For example, "Puer currens trans lineam advenit." translates as "The running boy arrives across the finish line." </p>
  <p>[On screen: "Puer currens trans lineam advenit." Below it, "running" is circled in the sentence "The <strong>running</strong> boy arrives across the finish line."] </p>
  <p>In English, "<strong>running</strong>" is a present active participle. </p>
  <p>In Latin, the "-ns" on "currens" is used to indicate the nominative, singular of this form. </p>
  <p>[On screen text: "<strong>currens</strong>" is circled in the sentence "Puer currens trans lineam advenit."] </p>
  <p>Participles agree with their nouns in case, number, and gender. </p>
  <p>For example, in the participle phrase "<strong>Puer currens</strong>" the participle "currens" uses the nominative, singular, masculine "-ns" ending because "puer" is the subject of the sentence. </p>
  <p>Now, change the sentence: </p>
  <p>"Canis pueri currentis trans lineam advenit." translates as "The dog <strong>of the running boy</strong> arrives across the finish line." The possessive noun "<strong>pueri</strong>" is in the genitive singular form. The participle becomes "<strong>currentis</strong>" to agree. [On screen text: "Of the running boy" is circled in the sentence "The dog <strong>of the running boy</strong> arrives across the finish line." "Pueri"  and "currentis" is circled in the sentence "Canis <strong>pueri currentis</strong> trans lineam advenit."] </p>
  <p>Watch for these participles when you translate, and don't forget the"-ing"! </p>
