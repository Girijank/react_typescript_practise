  <h2>Infinitives&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <h3>What is an Infinitive?</h3>
  <p>Announcer: An infinitive is a verbal noun that takes the place of a noun in a sentence. It doesn't have a subject, and it doesn't have different endings to indicate person. In translations, the word "to" is used to indicate an infinitive form.</p>
  <p>[On screen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a verbal noun</li>
    <li>does not have a subject </li>
    <li>does not have a "person" </li>
    <li>translated as "<strong>to&hellip;</strong>"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The word "to" is circled in "translated as <strong>to</strong>."]</p>
  <h3>Complementary Infinitives</h3>
  <p>The present Active infinitive form is the 2nd principal part of a verb, usually ending in "-re." </p>
  <p><em>salto</em>, <em>saltare</em>, <em>saltavi</em>, <em>saltatus</em>, -<em>a</em>, -<em>um</em>, the 2nd principal part is "<strong><em>saltare</em></strong>." [On screen: the term "saltare" is circled in the group of words "salto, <strong>saltare</strong>, saltavi, saltatus, -a, -um".] </p>
  <p>Translated as a present active infinitive, this means "to dance." [On screen:  saltare = to dance] </p>
  <p>A complementary infinitive is an infinitive being used as the direct object of another verb. </p>
  <p>Look at the sentence: "Puella saltare amat."(The girl loves to dance.) </p>
  <p>The infinitive "<strong>saltare</strong>" means "<strong>to dance</strong>" and follows the main verb in the English translation. [On screen: "saltare" is circled in the sentence "Puella <strong>saltare</strong> amat." "To dance" is circled in the sentence "The girl loves to <strong>dance</strong>."]</p>
  <h3>Infinitives with Possum</h3>
  <p>When the main verb of a Latin sentence is a form of "possum" (Latin for "am able"), you will almost always see an infinitive acting as its direct object. </p>
  <p>In the sentence "Puella <strong>saltare</strong> potest.", the infinitive "saltare" is being used to show that the girl is able <strong>to dance</strong>. [On screen: "saltare" is circled in the sentence "Puella <strong>saltare</strong> potest." "To dance" is circled in the sentence "The girl is able <strong>to dance</strong>."]</p>
  <h3>Infinitives with Sum</h3>
  <p>While infinitives are used as verbal nouns, they are not always the direct object. In a sentence where the main Latin verb is a form of "sum" (to be), the infinitive often behaves differently. </p>
  <p>In the sentence "<strong>Saltare</strong> est <em>viver</em>e."&mdash;"<strong>To dance</strong> is <em>to live</em>."&mdash;the infinitive is the subject, and the 2nd infinitive "vivere" is called the predicate nominative. [On screen: "Saltare" and "vivere" are circled in the sentence "<strong>Saltare</strong> est <em>vivere</em>." "To dance" and "to live" is circled in the sentence "<strong>To dance</strong> is <em>to live</em>."] </p>
