  <h2>Composing a Passive Voice Sentence in Latin</h2>
  <p>Follow these steps to help you write a Passive sentence in Latin:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write the sentence in English first, using simple grammar.</li>
    <li>Find the subject of the sentence: Could be a noun <strong>or</strong> a verb
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Noun subject</strong>: Write this subject in the <strong>nominative</strong> case. Check your noun declining charts for the correct noun form. Example: The <strong>man</strong> is loved by the woman. <strong>“The man”</strong> is the subject of the sentence and would need to be in the nominative case.
          <ul>
            <li> Write the subject as the first word in your composed sentence. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Verb subject</strong>: Check your verb conjugating charts for correct verb form. Example: <strong>We will be loved</strong> by the woman. The pronoun “we” is represented in Latin by the personal ending, -mur in the verb. Therefore, the verb is the subject of the sentence. Note: A 1<sup>st</sup> <strong>or</strong> 2<sup>nd</sup> person verb is <strong>always</strong> the subject of the sentence.
          <ul>
            <li>Write the verb as the last word in your composed sentence.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Write the verb in Latin, if you haven’t done so already. Check your verb conjugating charts for correct verb form.
      <ul>
        <li> If you have a <strong>noun subject</strong>, use 3<sup>rd</sup> singular or 3<sup>rd</sup> plural </li>
        <li>If you have a <strong>verb subject</strong>, you already took care of the verb in Step 2.
          <ul>
            <li> Write the verb as the last word in your composed sentence. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ablative of Agent: If there is an Ablative of Agent in the sentence, write it in its correct Ablative case and number. <strong>Remember</strong> the Ablative of Agent = a/ab + <strong>person</strong> in the <strong>ablative</strong> case.
      <ul>
        <li> Write the Ablative of Agent before the verb. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ablative of Means: If there is an ablative of means, add it before the verb. <strong>Remember</strong>: when you have a <strong>thing</strong> that’s used to complete the action of the verb, that’s ablative of means&mdash;just put the noun in the ablative case.</li>
    <li>Any remaining words: Identify the function of remaining words (Possessor, Indirect Object, Prepositional Phrase, Adverb) and write those words in their correct cases.
      <ul>
        <li> Possessor = Genitive case will follow the word it possesses </li>
        <li>Indirect Object = Dative case will be written closer to the verb</li>
        <li>Prepositional Phrase = Accusative or Ablative case following a preposition will need to be written where you’d put it in English</li>
        <li>Adverb will be written right before the verb in the sentence</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Nota Bene: </em>Sentence structure in Latin is flexible, but you can follow a general layout:</p>
  <p>Subject &#8680; indirect object &#8680; ablative &#8680; adverb &#8680; main verb</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every sentence will have at least a subject and a verb, but not necessarily the other cases.</li>
    <li>Adjectives after their nouns except if it’s a noun of size or quantity.</li>
    <li>Genitives follow the noun they possess/describe.</li>
  </ul>
