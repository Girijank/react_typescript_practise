  <h2>Noun Cases and their Uses&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: VO: Nouns are words used to represent people, places, or things. </p>
  <p>In Latin, nouns are special because they "decline"&mdash;meaning the endings change based on the way they are used in a sentence. [On Screen: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative] </p>
  <p>The endings help you know which case your noun is in, since each one has a special purpose. </p>
  <p>The Nominative Case is used as the subject&mdash;the person or thing that completes the action of the sentence. </p>
  <p>The sentence "Agricola feminam amat." means "The farmer loves the woman." </p>
  <p><strong><em>Agricola</em> (the farmer)</strong> is in the Nominative case because he is the one who "loves" in this sentence. [On screen: "Agricola" is circled in the sentence "<strong>Agricola</strong> feminam amat." and "the farmer" is circled in the sentence "The farmer loves <strong>the woman</strong>."] </p>
  <p>The Genitive Case shows possession—indicating ownership using "of" or "apostrophe s" </p>
  <p>The sentence "Agricola casam feminae amat." means "The farmer loves the house of the woman." </p>
  <p><strong><em>Feminae</em> (of the woman)</strong> is in the Genitive case because it is taking ownership of the house. [On screen: "Feminae" is circled in the sentence "Agricola casam <strong>feminae</strong> amat." and "of the woman" is circled in the sentence "The farmer loves the house <strong>of the woman.</strong>"] </p>
  <p>The Dative Case shows the indirect object—a noun which indirectly receives the action of a verb of giving, showing, or telling. </p>
  <p>The sentence "Agricola feminae rosas dat." means "The farmer gives roses to the woman." </p>
  <p><strong><em>Feminae</em> (to the woman)</strong> is in the Dative case because she is indirectly receiving the roses, and the verb of this sentence is "dat" (from do, dare, to give). [On screen: "Feminae" is circled in the sentence "Agricola <strong>feminae</strong> rosas dat." and "to the woman" is circled in the sentence "The farmer gives roses <strong>to the woman</strong>."] </p>
  <p>The Accusative case shows the direct object of a sentence. The direct object directly receives the action of the verb. </p>
  <p>The sentence "Agricola feminam amat." means "The farmer loves the woman." </p>
  <p><strong><em>Feminam</em></strong> is in the Accusative case because it receives the action of the verb "loves." [On screen: "Feminam" is circled in the sentence "Agricola <strong>feminam</strong> amat." and "the woman" is circled in the sentence "The farmer loves <strong>the woman</strong>."] </p>
  <p>The Ablative case has a variety of uses in Latin. Most commonly it is translated as the object of a preposition, following words like "with," "by," or "in." [On Screen: Object of a preposition: the noun translated, following prepositions like "with," "by," or "in".] </p>
  <p>The sentence "Agricola in casa habitat." means "The farmer lives in the house." </p>
  <p><strong><em>Casa</em></strong> is the Ablative case because the noun is the object of the preposition "in." [On screen: "Casa" is circled in the sentence "Agricola in <strong>casa</strong> habitat." and "house" is circled in the sentence "The farmer lives in <strong>the house</strong>."] </p>
  <p>Knowing the use of these most common cases will help you conquer Latin translations! [On screen text appears: Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Ablative]</p>
