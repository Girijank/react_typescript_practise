  <h2>Sum and Possum&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: Today, you are going to learn about the irregular verbs "sum" and "possum." Let's begin.</p>
  <h3>Irregular Verbs: Sum and Possum</h3>
  <p>The verbs "sum" and "possum" are irregular verbs. When forming these verbs, they do not follow the same pattern as a regular Latin verb. </p>
  <p>[On screen: sum, esse, fui, futurus, -a, -um = to be; possum, posse, potui- = to be able] </p>
  <p>Instead, they conjugate to the beat of a different drum. </p>
  <p>Take a look at the sentences. <em>Poeta sum.</em> (I am a poet.) and <em>Poeta non es.</em> (You are not a poet.) </p>
  <p>Notice that "<strong>sum</strong>" and "<strong>es</strong>" both mean "to be," using different subjects, but the forms look completely different. [On screen: "sum" is circled in the sentence "Poeta <strong>sum</strong>." and "I am" is circled in the sentence "<strong>I am</strong> a poet." "es" is circled in the sentence "Poeta non <strong>es</strong>." and "you are" is circled in the sentence "<strong>You are</strong> not a poet."] </p>
  <p>[On screen: A table is displayed where "sum" is circled in the 1st person singular.] </p>
  <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Singular</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Plural</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">1st Person</th>
        <td><strong><em>sum</em></strong><br />
          I am</td>
        <td><strong>sumus</strong><br />
          we are</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">2nd Person</th>
        <td><strong>es</strong><br />
          you are</td>
        <td><strong>estis</strong><br />
          you all are</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">3rd Person</th>
        <td><strong>est</strong><br />
          he/she/it is</td>
        <td><strong>sunt</strong><br />
          they are</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The forms of "sum" in the present tense do not form any particular pattern. Instead, they need to be memorized. </p>
  <p>Once you have your present tense of "sum" memorized, you are ready to learn the verb "possum." </p>
  <p>Take a look at these sentences: <em>Saltare possum.</em> (I am able to dance.) and <em>Saltare non potes.</em> (You are not able to dance.) </p>
  <p>Can you spot the forms of "sum" in the verbs of these sentences? </p>
  <p>[On screen: A table is displayed where the first part of the word "pos" is underlined and the second part of the words are circled&mdash;"<em>sum</em>," "<em>sumus</em>" and "<em>sunt</em>." in "<strong>pos</strong>sum," "<strong>pos</strong>sumus" and <strong>pos</strong>sunt." The first part of the word, the "pot" is underlined and the second part of the words are circled - "es," "est" and "estis." in "<strong>pot</strong>es," "<strong>pot</strong>est" and "<strong>pot</strong>estis."] </p>
  <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Singular</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Plural</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">1st Person</th>
        <td><strong>pos</strong><em>sum</em><br />
          I am able</td>
        <td><strong>pos</strong><em>sumus</em><br />
          we are able</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">2nd Person</th>
        <td><strong>pot</strong><em>es</em><br />
          you are able</td>
        <td><strong>pot</strong><em>estis</em><br />
          you all are able</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">3rd Person</th>
        <td><strong>pot</strong><em>est</em><br />
          he/she/it is able</td>
        <td><strong>pos</strong><em>sunt</em><br />
          they are able</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>When forming "possum" in the present tense, all that is needed is an additional "pos" in front of "sum," "sumus," or "sunt" and "pot" in front of "es, est, or estis."</p>
  <p>Have these forms memorized, and any time you encounter "sum" or "possum" in your translations, you will know what to do with these irregular verb friends! </p>
