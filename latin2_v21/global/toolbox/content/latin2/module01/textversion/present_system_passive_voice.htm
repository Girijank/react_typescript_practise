    <h2>Present System Passive Voice&mdash;Text Version</h2>	 
   
	  <p>Announcer: Let's talk about the Present System Passive Voice.</p>
<p>In the Passive Voice, the subject receives the action of the verb, rather than completing the action. The present system Passive does so in three tenses: present, imperfect, and future.
</p>
<p>[On screen: Aedifico, aedificare, aedificavi, aedificatus, -a, -um = to build]
</p>
<p>The first piece of the present system, Passive Voice puzzle is your present stem&mdash;the 2nd principal part, minus the -re. [On screen: Puzzle piece appears with "aedificare" and then transitions to remove "re". Final word on puzzle piece "aedifica".]
</p>
<p>[On screen: Table displays with "-tur" is circled.]</p>
	  
	<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Singular</th>
        <th class="black white-text" scope="col">Plural</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">1st Person</th>
        <td>-r</td>
        <td>-mur</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">2nd Person</th>
        <td>-ris</td>
        <td>-mini</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">3rd Person</th>
        <td><strong>-tur</strong></td>
        <td>-ntur</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>  
<p>The next piece of the puzzle is the Passive personal endings (-r, -ris, <strong>-tur</strong>, -mur, -mini, -ntur).</p>
<p>[On screen: Puzzle piece appears with "aedfica," a second puzzle piece appears with "tur" on it and pieces join together.] Added to your present stem, this piece forms a present tense, Passive Voice verb. [On screen: puzzle piece appears with "aedificatur."] Remember, in the Passive Voice, the subject receives the action of the verb.</p>
<h3>Present Tense, Passive Voice</h3>

<p>"<em>Villa ab agricola aedificatur.</em>" (The farmhouse is being built by the farmer.)</p>
<p>We use the "<strong>-tur</strong>" ending to indicate present tense, 3rd person, singular because the house <strong>is being built</strong>. The house is receiving the action. [On screen: "tur" is circled in the sentence "Villa ab agricola aedifica<strong>tur</strong>." "Is being built" is circled in the sentence "The farmhouse <strong>is being built by</strong> the farmer."]</p>
<h3>The Imperfect Tense, Passive Voice</h3>

<p>The imperfect tense, Passive Voice uses the same pieces. [On screen: "Villa ab agricola aedificabatur" (The farmhouse was being built by the farmer.)] 
</p>
<p>The present stem and Passive Voice personal endings, with a new piece in between&mdash;the imperfect "<strong>ba</strong>". [On screen text: "ba" is circled in the sentence "Villa ab agricola aedifica<strong>ba</strong>tur."]
</p>
<p><em>Aedificatur becomes aedifica<strong>ba</strong>tur</em>&mdash;<strong>the farmhouse <strong>was being built</strong> by</strong> the farmer. [On screen text: "Was being built" is circled in the sentence "The farmhouse <strong>was being built</strong> by the farmer."]</p>
<h3>Future Tense, Passive Voice</h3>

<p>In the 1st and 2nd conjugation, the future tense Passive Voice uses <em>bor</em>, <em>beris</em>, <em>bitur</em>, <em>bimur</em>, <em>bimini</em> and <em>buntur</em> to indicate "will be," like in the sentence "<em>Villa ab agricola aedificabitur.</em>" (The farmhouse <strong>will be built</strong> by the farmer.) [On screen text: "bi" is circled in the sentence "Villa ab agricola aedificabitur."  "Will be built" is circled in the sentence "The farmhouse <strong>will be built</strong> by the farmer."]
</p>
<p>The 3rd and 4th conjugations use the same "<strong>ie</strong>" piece as the future Active Voice, with Passive Voice personal endings added on, like in "<em>Villa ab agricola munietur.</em>" (The farmhouse <strong>will be fortified</strong> by the farmer.) [On screen text: "ie" is circled in the sentence "Villa ab agricola munietur." "will be fortified" is circled in the sentence "The farmhouse <strong>will be fortified</strong> by the farmer."]
</p>
<p>In all of the examples, no matter how the tense of the verb endings changes, just remember that the subject receives the action!
