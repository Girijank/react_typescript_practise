  <h2>Verb Principle Parts&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Announcer: Ever wonder why verbs in a Latin dictionary have so many parts?</p>
  <p>It all comes down to principal parts and how they are used to form Latin verbs! </p>
  <p>Verbs are used to describe an action, state, or occurrence. In a Latin dictionary, verbs look like this: </p>
  <p>[On screen: Table of verbs] <em>amo</em>, <em>amare</em>, <em>amavi</em>, <em>amatus</em>, -<em>a</em>, -<em>um</em>. </p>
   <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">1st PP</th>
		  <th scope="col">2nd PP</th>
		  <th scope="col">3rd PP</th>
		  <th scope="col">4th PP</th>
		  <th scope="col">English Meaning</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong><em>amo</em></strong></td>
        <td><strong><em>amare</em></strong></td>
		  <td><strong><em>amavi</em></strong></td>
		  <td><strong><em>amatus, -a, -um</em></strong></td>
		  <td><strong>to love</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Most Latin verbs have four principal parts. You'll need to memorize all four principal parts when you learn a new verb. [On screen: "amo," "amare," "amavi" and "amatus, -a, -um" are circled, "to love" has a heart drawn around it.] </p>
  <p>Each verb part serves a purpose. </p>
  <p>The 1st Principal Part is the Present Tense 1st person singular of the verb. </p>
  <p><em>Amo</em> means "I love." </p>
  <p>The 2nd Principal Part is the infinitive of the verb. </p>
  <p><em>Amare</em>, in a sentence, means "to love." </p>
  <p>You will also use the 2nd Principal Part to form the stem for all of your present system verbs. </p>
  <p>The 3rd Principal Part is the Perfect Tense, 1st person singular of the verb. </p>
  <p>For example: </p>
  <p><em>Amavi</em> means, I have loved. </p>
  <p>You will also use the 3rd Principal Part for the stem of your Perfect system, Active verbs. </p>
  <p>The 4th Principal Part of the verb is the Perfect Passive Participle or "PPP." </p>
  <p><em>amatus</em>, -<em>a</em>, <em>um</em> means, having been loved </p>
  <p>Notice that the 4th Principal Part has adjective endings "<strong>-us</strong>, <strong>-a</strong>, <strong>-um</strong>." This is because the PPP will agree with its subject in case, number, and gender. [On screen: "us, -a, -um" are underlined in "amat<em>us</em>, -<em>a</em>, -<em>um</em>"] </p>
  <p>The PPP is also used for forming the Passive Voice of the perfect system. </p>
  <p>And that's it! Let's put those Principal Parts to work! </p>
