        <h2>Ablative of Means</h2>

        <p><strong>English Usage</strong></p>

        <p>Let's think about English. Remember that translating often depends on the context of your sentence and should sound natural in English, depending on this context. Sometimes context clues like images, previous sentences, or other wording in the sentence can help. See if you can complete these sentences that describe the actions in the pictures.</p>

        <p>Did you notice that in all the sentences somebody uses an object to perform the action? In English we usually use the phrase "with ______" (or "by ______").</p>

        <ul>
            <li>with a spoon</li>
            <li>with crayons</li>
            <li>with a bat</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Latin Usage</strong></p>

        <p>The Romans had a much shorter and faster way of saying the same thing. Latin does not use the word "with" ("cum") in sentences like these. Instead, Latin uses just the noun in the Ablative case. Let's look at some examples. </p>
        
        <p>This use of the Ablative case is called Ablative of means because it shows the "means by which" something is done. You must supply the English word "with" (or "by") in front of the noun when you are translating it.</p>
