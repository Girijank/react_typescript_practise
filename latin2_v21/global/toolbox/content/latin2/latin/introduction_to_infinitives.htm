        <h2>Introduction to Infinitives</h2>

        

        <ul>
            <li>An infinitive is the part of a verb which is unaffected by person or number. In English, this part of a verb is easily recognized as it is preceded by “to” (e.g., “to call”).</li>
            <li>When you look up a Latin verb in a Latin–English dictionary, you will see four entries (principal parts) for most verbs. The second entry—usually abbreviated "-are," "-ere," or "-ire"—is the infinitive.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <p><strong>Latin infinitives</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>do not have person</li>
            <li>are translated to______</li>
            <li>are found in the present Active as the second principal part: portare (to carry), regere (to rule)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Present Active Infinitive</strong></p>

        <p>In a dictionary, the present Active infinitive form of a verb is shown as the second principal part, and we have come across it several times already.</p>

        <p class="text-center"><em>voco, <strong>vocare</strong>, vocavi, vocatus, -a, -um</em> =  to call</p>

        <p>Normally the ending for first conjugation verbs is “-are”; second conjugation verbs “–ere”; third conjugation verbs “-ere”; and fourth conjugation verbs “-ire.”</p>

        <p>More specifically, it's the present Active infinitive, which is translated into English as "to" plus whatever the verb means.</p>

        <p><strong>Infinitive Endings for Conjugation Identification:</strong></p>
        <p>1<sup>st</sup> Conjugation: -are</p>
        <p>2<sup>nd</sup> Conjugation: -ere</p>
        <p>3<sup>rd</sup> Conjugation: -ere</p>
        <p>4<sup>th</sup> Conjugation: -ire</p>

        <p><strong>Complementary Infinitive</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A complementary infinitive is</strong> an infinitive used to complete an action of the sentence.</p>
        <p>Latin examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Libros <strong>legere</strong> amo</em>. I love <strong>to read</strong> books.</li>
        </ul>
