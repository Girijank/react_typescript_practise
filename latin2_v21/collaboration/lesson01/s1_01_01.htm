    <h1>Stop and Collaborate</h1>
    <p>The Roman Monarchy was a fascinating period, lasting from 753 BCE&ndash;509 BCE in Rome, where seven kings ruled the city. The seven kings were all very interesting in their own rights. Some were noble, some were distrustful, and one in particular was kicked out of Rome! Nevertheless, they all contributed to the creation of the physical, legal, and cultural infrastructure of Rome, much of which still lives on, not only in modern Rome, but in our everyday cultures worldwide. For this collaboration, you will have the opportunity to discuss one of the kings in a fun and exciting way. Let’s get started!</p>
    <p>This collaboration has three parts:</p>
