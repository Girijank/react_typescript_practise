		<h1>Collaboration: What you need to know</h1>
		<p>Working with others is an important skill to develop and one you will use often in your future education and
			career paths. In this lesson, you will explore the types of collaboration opportunities available and
			guidelines for completion. Get ready to work together!
		</p>

		<h3 class="carousel-title">But how?</h3>
		<p>Collaboration can be completed synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous collaboration is live—all
			participants are working on the project at the same time. This may be accomplished on the phone, in a live
			lesson with your teacher, face-to-face, or via another method of real-time collaboration. To collaborate
			asynchronously, participants each complete a part of the project independently. This may include adding to
			what your partner has already done. For asynchronous collaboration, all participants do not necessarily have
			to be available at the same time. Select the images to learn more about each type of collaboration.
