		<h1>Stop and Collaborate</h1>

		<p>The Roman Empire, beginning from 27 BCE and lasting until the fall of the western empire in 476 CE, was the
			most dominating empire the world had ever seen. The Roman emperors were all monumental characters who
			changed the face of the earth. One can never tire of studying any of the emperors because they all had such
			huge personalities—some good, some bad, and some incredibly questionable. For this collaboration, you will
			have the opportunity to explore one of your favorite emperors and discuss your likes and dislikes about the
			emperor in a fun and exciting way. Let’s get started!</p>
		<p>This collaboration has three parts:</p>

		<div class="tabs fevTabsHolderWidth" data-maxwidth="auto">
			<a class="tab">Part One</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<div class="row">
					<p><strong>Answer the following questions and record your answers:</strong></p>
					<p>Select an emperor from the Roman Empire (27 BCE—476 CE):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Write down at least four interesting facts about the emperor.</li>
						<li>Find images of two architectural structures that the emperor created.</li>
						<li>Write down at least two events, architectural structures, or activities the emperor created
							that are still relevant today.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Include the following:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Give three sentences in <strong>Latin</strong>, introducing your selected emperor. Include
							his name, the dates of his reign, and what he was most known for (in complete sentences).
						</li>
						<li>Prepare one paragraph of at least 4–5 sentences, in <strong>English</strong>, comparing the
							activities, architectural monuments, or leadership traits of your chosen emperor to those
							that are still relevant today.</li>
						<li>Create an eight-question survey of questions to ask your partner. The first four questions
							should be in <strong>Latin</strong>, asking your partner the name of his/her emperor, what
							he/she liked or disliked about the emperor, and an architectural monument that the emperor
							created. The remaining four questions should be in <strong>English</strong>, asking your
							partner about which emperor they chose and other details that they included in their
							description.</li>
					</ul>
