				<p>Have you ever thought about what the society was like in ancient China and how it differs now in modern China? Do you know how women’s social status has changed over time and how family structures are affected by the social hierarchies in China? Now, let’s learn about these topics through Lili Chen, who is currently doing a project for her social studies class and is researching family structures in China. Let's review some information she has found.</p>

						<p>Traditional families in China are usually quite large. It is common for a family to have three or even four generations living under the same roof, which is also considered a symbol of family prosperity. In modern China, traditionally large families have become smaller units. Now, many people older than 60 live separately from their adult children, and many young people leave their families behind to find work in big cities.</p>

						<p>In a traditional family in ancient China, male members had authority over female members. This is because China’s agricultural society required manpower in the field, and families needed male heirs to carry on the family name. Traditionally, sons are more valued than daughters, and girls were more likely to be given up for adoption when family difficulties occurred.</p>

						<p>In traditional families in ancient China, women’s social roles were mostly kinship roles such as wife and mother. Women were not allowed to work outside of the family. By the 1900s, girls in China were required to bind their feet from 4–6 years old until adulthood. In modern China, women can work and receive education outside their homes and are now considered “the bearers of half the sky” in China.</p>

						<p>China started a one-child policy in the late 1970s, requiring each couple to have only one child. In 2013, the Chinese government relaxed this policy to allow each couple to have two children. </p>

		  <p>Let’s also learn about the unique matriarchal society in China.</p>

		<p>China is not all patriarchal. There exists a “Kingdom of the Women” in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southwest China. It is a small ethnic group called “Mosuo,” with a population of 50,000, living near Lugu Lake. Mosuo people have a matriarchal society. They trace their family lineage through the female side of the family, and women play the dominant role in all aspects in their society. </p>
