View the slides, and then answer the self-check questions that follow.</p>

						  <hr />
						 <p>My great-grandma, who is in her 90s, told me her love story with my great-grandpa back in the 1940s. My great-grandma was 25 and not engaged, which was considered “old” in her time. Then my great-grandpa, who saw her at the market once, came to visit her father with a decent amount of “bride price,” hoping for his approval. While they were talking in the living room, my great-grandma took a peek at my great-grandpa behind the door. She liked him and asked her dad to approve. They then got married. My great-grandma said they never even touched each other’s hands before their marriage.</p>

					   <h4>Dating and Marriage (a love story)</h4>
						  <hr />
						<p>My maternal great-grandparents have already passed away, but my maternal grandma told me their love story. My great-grandpa was a veteran from World War II. He was already an American citizen at that time. He and my great-grandma, who worked at her dad’s grocery store in San Francisco, already had been dating for a year when he joined the war. They exchanged love letters and pictures of each other weekly and affectionately until the war was over. Once they reunited, they got married right away and were never separated the rest of their lives. </p>
