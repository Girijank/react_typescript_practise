        <h2>The Majority of Chinese</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>The majority of Chinese people are the Han (Mandarin) ethnic group (<span lang="zh-Hans"><em>汉族</em></span><em> Hànzú</em>). The Han culture is the dominant national culture, which has thousands of years of history and numerous achievements that contribute to the world civilization. For example, the four great inventions of ancient China (<span lang="zh-Hans"><em>四大发明</em></span><em> sì dà fāmíng</em>)—papermaking, printing, gunpowder, and the compass—are known to have advanced the human civilization.</p>
		<p>The Han culture also has rich artistic and cultural contributions. For example, Chinese folk music and Chinese traditional musical instruments such as the <span lang="zh-Hans"><em>琵琶</em></span><em> pípa</em> (pipa) and <span lang="zh-Hans"><em>古筝</em></span><em> gǔzhēng</em> (guzheng) are greatly appreciated internationally. Chinese poets <em><span lang="zh-Hans">李白</span> Lǐ Bái</em> (Li Bai) and <span lang="zh-Hans"><em>杜甫</em></span><em> Dù Fǔ</em> (Du Fu) are also well-known and studied by scholars throughout the world.</p>
		<p>Modern China is working to promote and preserve a sense of unified national identify across all ethnic groups, majority or minority, based on the ideals of equality and hard work.</p>
		<p><strong>The Minority Ethnic Groups</strong></p>

		<p>There are 56 ethnic groups in China, including the Han ethnic group as the majority. The 55 minority groups are spread mostly in the northwest, southwest, and west of China. Yunnan Province, located in Southwestern China, has 25 minority ethnic groups, the most among all provinces in China.</p>
		<p>The minority ethnic groups in China mostly preserve their own languages, arts, and traditions. For example, the Mongolian ethnic group in Northern China preserves its traditional Horse Rider's Dance, and its ancient throat singing technique called <span lang="zh-Hans"><em>呼麦</em></span><em> hūmài</em> (Khoomei), with which two or three harmonies can be heard from the same person at the same time. It mimics the sound of wind, swirling through rocks.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, minority ethnic groups in China seek to identify with the national Han culture while preserving their own. All ethnic groups are actively learning the Han language (Mandarin Chinese) and culture, and at the same time, advocating their own language, traditions, and culture. Just like the old Chinese saying, <span lang="zh-Hans"><em>求大同，存小异</em></span><em> Qiúdàtóng, cúnxiǎoyì</em>. (Seek the overall unity, keep minor differences.)</p>
		<p><strong>Distribution of Ethnic Groups</strong></p>
		<p>The list below shows examples of where some minority ethnic groups mostly locate at:</p>
		<p><strong>Mongol (Mongolians) ethnic group</strong>&mdash;the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region in northern China</p>
		<p><strong>Zang (Tibetan) ethnic group</strong>&mdash;the Tibetan Autonomous Region in northwestern China</p>
		<p><strong>Zhuang ethnic group</strong>&mdash;the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China</p>
		<p><strong>Li ethnic group</strong>&mdash;Hainan Province, an island in Southern China</p>
		<p><strong>Miao (Hmong) ethnic group</strong>&mdash;In southwestern China</p>
		<p><strong>Weiwu'er (Uygur) ethnic group</strong>&mdash;the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions in northwestern China</p>
