		<h1>Why Are You Taking a Pretest? </h1>

		<p>The pretest shows what you already know about the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> content and what you still need to learn. It also helps your instructor guide you through the learning process. The pretest will not negatively impact your grade in this course.</p>

		<p>While taking the pretest, please do not use any notes or reference materials. You are not expected to know the material on the pretest already. If you do not know the answer to a question—don't worry! Just try your best.</p>

					<p><strong>When completing the pretest, it is important to pay attention and not get kicked out. Here are some situations that can lock you out, lose all of your hard work, and give you grief:</strong></p>

					<p>If you are not working consistently on the pretest, your internet service provider may kick you offline. This means you would lose all of your work and have to start over. Your instructor will have to reset the pretest for you if this happens.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Stepping away or working inconsistently on the pretest may kick you offline. If you lose all of your work and have to start over, be sure to contact your instructor for support with resetting your pretest.</li>
						<li>You cannot open the pretest, take your dog for a walk, and then come back. Leaving the pretest, even to complete it on paper, will count as a submission even if there aren't any answers.</li>
						<li>You cannot minimize your browser or work in more than one browser at a time during the pretest.</li>
						<li>Opening any other parts of the course while taking the pretest will get you locked out.</li>
