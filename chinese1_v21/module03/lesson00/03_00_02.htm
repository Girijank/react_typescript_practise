		<h1>International Chinese — A quick guide to North and Northeast China</h1>

		<p>By now you’ve learned how Chinese is spoken and used in Mainland China and regions such as Hong Kong and Macau. The vast use of the language has also flourished in rich cultures based on regions. Let’s explore Northern China, where Mandarin Chinese is widely spoken in people’s everyday lives, as well as look at its unique culture.</p>

							<p>North China (<span lang="zh-Hans">华北</span> Huáběi) usually refers to Beijing, the capital of China, Tiajin, a nearby city, and five provinces surrounding them: Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia. The region is known as the “back of the rooster” since the overall map of China resembles a rooster.</p>
							<p>North China is considered the cradle of Chinese civilization along the Yellow River and its tributaries sprawling through the area. It has been home to many dynasties and empires in Chinese history.</p>
							<p>Mandarin Chinese is widely spoken in this region as the standard dialect and official language, with very slight variations. In Inner Mongolia, many people speak both Mongolian and Mandarin.</p>

							<p>Northeast China is located outside of the Great Wall, which was built long ago in history to protect China from nomadic tribes. Nowadays, the region is the “rust belt” of the nation, best known for its heavy industry and vast natural forests.</p>
							<p>The dialect spoken in Northeast China is Northeastern Mandarin, which has slight variation from standard Mandarin. It has some unique characteristics such as <span lang="zh-Hans">儿化音</span> Érhuàyīn (Erhua), which adds “er” sounds at the end of many syllables, to distinguish it as a dialect.</p>
