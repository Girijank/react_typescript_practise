				<p>Excellent job moving along in this course. Now that you can describe your immediate family, let’s extend your vocabulary to describe even more. Imagine you are visiting your friend from China, and his grandparents are visiting. If they want to know how you are doing with your Chinese learning, wouldn’t be great if you were able to address and describe them in Chinese?
