        <p><strong>Tingting Wang</strong></p>

		<p>Hello! My name is Tingting Wang. I’m 8 years old, and I live in Shanghai, China. My family has my mom, my dad, and me. I am an only child. My paternal grandparents, whom I call yeye and nainai, live in the same city. My dad is their only child, and they visit us often. When my parents are busy at work, my yeye and nainai take care of me. They always say that I’m their only grandchild, and it’s their responsibility to take care of me.
            <p>I call my mom’s parents waigong and waipo. They live in a nearby city called Wuxi. They live with my “jiujiu,” my mom’s older brother, and his family. My mom’s side of the family is quite large. I have an uncle, my “jiujiu,” and two aunts, whom I call “dayi”(first maternal aunt) and “eryi”(2nd maternal aunt). I have a total of four cousins. Once a year, my mom takes me to Wuxi to visit her relatives, and then I get to see my cousins and play with them. We also often communicate online for updates of our lives.</p>

         <p><strong>Grandpa Chen</strong></p>
            
         <p>I am Tingting’s grandfather. When I was a child, I lived in a small village in southwest China where my grandparents, my father, his three brothers, and their families all lived under the same roof. After they got married, my aunts went to live with their husbands’ families. The men in my family ran a  <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Rickshaw</strong>: a vehicle similar to a three-wheeled bicycle, having a seat for passengers behind the driver" data-position="top">rickshaw</span> renting business for a living, while the women at home cooked, cleaned, and took care of the children together. I was very close to my cousins since we grew up together. </p> 
         <p>My grandfather kept a family tree record called “Jiapu (family tree).” This record shows the Chen family history at least five generations back, including the family lineage, history, locations, and achievements. With Jiapu, we could trace and find any Chen family member no matter how far they go and how long it has been. For example, about 100 years ago, one of the family members moved to Northern China and started a family there. Now his offspring, over 50 people with last name Chen, have been in touch with us with the help of Jiapu. </p>

         <p><strong>Your turn</strong></p>

         <p>How do your family and your grandparents’ childhood family compare with that of Tingting and Grandpa Chen? What are some things you have in common? Is your family more like Tingting’s or her grandfather’s? It’s always nice to appreciate the past and the present from your own culture.</p>
