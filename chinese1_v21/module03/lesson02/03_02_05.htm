							<p>The population in China is aging faster than most countries in modern history. Currently, it has the largest number of senior citizens (65 or older) in the world. In 2015, 9.5 percent of the Chinese population was 65 or older or roughly 1 in every 10 people. It’s projected that by 2050, China will have 400 million people who are 60 or older.  </p>

							<p>Traditionally in China, the elderly live with one of their children and his or her family. Many families nowadays still live this way. In the 2010s, more than 75 percent of China’s seniors, 65 or older, lived with their children. However, the fast-paced modern life in present day China has caused changes in family structures. More young adults live by themselves and have little time to take care of their elderly. Traditional family-based care is becoming impractical, and in the future, many of the elderly in China will face increasing challenges in finding care for themselves.</p>

							<p>With the increasing number of elderly people living by themselves, China is quickly lacking enough housing for senior citizens. As a solution, China is encouraging private and foreign investors to be part of the senior housing market. The government’s related policies are becoming clearer and more specific. For now, home senior care has been the mainstream in Chinese society because of its deep roots in traditions. However, due to the increasing number of senior citizens without those to care for them, senior group living is becoming more appealing.</p>

						<p>Facing the upcoming crisis, cities in China are acting quickly with combined efforts of families, the local community, and society. Many cities are developing service networks to serve their senior citizens both physically and mentally. For example, in Sanming City in Fujian province, dozens of new senior centers have been built to provide medical care, community services, and entertainment for senior citizens. The government also encourages seniors to actively participate in some social activities to contribute their knowledge and life experiences. </p>
