				<p>Amazing job working through this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> with flying colors! You are now able to introduce your immediate family members and pets. You can also introduce your grandparents and describe their personalities and appearances. Now you can also describe your family’s origin. Your vocabulary has greatly increased to construct descriptive sentences. Totally wonderful! </p>
				<p>Earlier in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you watched a dialogue video to see how Chinese works in the speaking world. Now let’s review the <a href="../../module03/lesson04/videopop/page04.htm" class="fev_downloadbtn" target="_blank" role="button" >				
					<strong>dialogue video</strong></a> to refresh your listening skills.</p>
				<p>Now that you have practiced your listening, speaking, and reading about family and descriptions in Chinese, how about we practice writing it? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, let’s explore and refine your writing skills.</p>

		<p>Have you seen a family tree before? Every family has its lineage trace, which is like the tree trunk, while members of the family that connect to each other by blood and by love are like leaves on the tree to make it prosperous and evergreen. Have you drawn a family tree of your own with at least three generations included—your grandparents, your parents, and your own generation? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will learn to create a family tree in Chinese characters. With this knowledge, you will be able to create a family tree of your own, which can be a beautiful gift to your family, made with love. It can even be hung up in your family living room!</p>
