		<h1><span lang="zh-Hans">写汉字</span> Xiě Hànzì Writing Chinese Characters</h1>

		<p>It’s now time to see how the writing rules apply. Below is a demonstration of how the 20 Chinese characters that you’ve learned in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> are written, stroke by stroke. You will use these characters, and any others from previous <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s, for the creation of your family tree at the end of this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. </p>

		<!-- <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also <a href="docs/module_2_charaters_spreadsheet.pdf" role="button" target="_blank" class="fev_downloadbtn">
		<strong>view</strong></a> the stroke sequences of <strong>all</strong> the characters you’ve learned so far in this module on the worksheet.  You can practice them on your own if you are interested.</p> -->
