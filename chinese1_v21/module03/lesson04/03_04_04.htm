				<p>Now let’s put these characters into action. You will create a family collage, based on one of the
					scenarios provided below, and then write two descriptive sentences to describe two of the family
					members on the collage.</p>

				<p>When creating the family collage and writing the descriptive sentences, you can use the characters
					taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> and/or the characters you’ve learned previously. You are expected to use at
					least 20 characters to fill up your family collage</p>

				<p>Use the <a href="docs/resources_decription_review.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button"
						target="_blank"> <strong>Descriptions Review</strong></a> worksheet to review the adjectives and
					adverbs of degree you can use to form descriptive sentences.</p>

				<p>Families come in different shapes and sizes. Create your own family collage design or look online for
					an existing template that matches your family. Remember that you can “customize” any of the
					templates you find by adding or removing boxes, or by moving them around to suit your own situation.
					Have fun!</p>

				<div class="content">
					<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario A</h2>
					<p>Create a family collage or a family tree for your own family. Include at least three generations
						of your family with at least six members (you and at least five others). Don’t forget about any
						pet(s) the family has. Then write three descriptive sentences to describe two of the family
						members on the collage.</p>
				</div>
			</div>


			<div class="well fev_scenario">
				<div class="content">
					<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario B</h2>
					<p>Create a family collage or a family tree for a famous person and his/her family. Include at least
						three generations of the family and at least six members (you and at least five others). Make
						yourself part of the family tree as well. (Imagine being martial arts actor and stuntman Jackie
						Chan’s grandchild or even Nikki SooHoo’s younger sibling!) Don’t forget about any pet(s) the
						family has. Then write three descriptive sentences to describe two of the family members on the
						collage.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>


		<p>Complete the contents of the family collage, using the appropriate characters from the
			demonstrations on the <strong>"Writing Chinese Characters"</strong> teaching and/or any other characters you’ve
			learned previously. You can choose to handwrite the characters or type the characters directly
			onto a word document, and then save the document as your work.</p>


		<!-- <p><strong>Note:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to type or handwrite the characters in the worksheet instead of copying and pasting them from
				the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. You are encouraged to handwrite the characters when possible. It is the best way to
				understand the characters. </li>
			<li>You can also consider using the characters you’ve learned and used in the previous workshop for this
				activity, wherever you see it applicable.</li>
