			<p>How did you do creating the family tree in the previous <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? I bet you’ve done a phenomenal job demonstrating your writing skills. Now it’s time to put your verbal skills into action. Yes, we will have a conversation—in Chinese. You will have a discussion-based conversation with your instructor to showcase your learning.</p>
			<p>What do you need? When you contact your instructor, be sure to have a method to do a two-way audio/video exchange. What will you do or say? Easy—you'll show off your interpersonal and interpretive communication skills by engaging in an instructor-directed chat. And you have an opportunity to ask your instructor questions. Don't worry; you can take notes to use so you know what you want to say and ask and how to respond.</p>
			<p>Let's cover the specific requirements for your discussion so you can knock this out. During your Discussion-Based Assessment, you will use Chinese to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>actively participate in a basic conversation about families in Chinese</li>
			</ul>
			<p>During the conversation, your instructor may ask additional questions about the Chinese language and culture. These questions may be asked and answered verbally in English, especially when it involves the Chinese culture.</p>
