  <p>It’s now time to see what you’ve learned in action. Watch the dialogue video to see how the vocabulary and structures you’ve learned so far can be used in real-life settings; then you can apply them in your own daily life.</p>

      <h2>Helpful Hint</h2>
      <p>When viewing the dialogue videos in this course, remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Watch each video twice. First, listen through it to see how much you can initially understand.
          Pay attention to the context and non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements.</li>
        <li>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything during the first viewing. Make use of the closed
          captioning to help you understand. Pause the video when necessary, so you can have a full view of
          the sentences in characters or pinyin.</li>
        <li>Feel free to speak along with the dialogue in the video. This will help you build a strong sense
          of intonations, pronunciations, and cadence in Chinese speech.</li>
        <li>Read the comprehension questions beforehand. Keep the questions in mind while watching the
          video.</li>
        <li>Answer the questions in your note guide and then check your answers. <strong>Note</strong>: You
          will have similar questions on the assessments, so be sure to take the time to practice now. </li>
      </ul>
