<h2>How do I submit an Assessment?</h2>
	<h3>Types of Assessments</h3>
	<p>Assessments are used to develop and/or evaluate your understanding of a concept. The concepts will be presented in the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s of the course. To access the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s and specific directions for each assessment, select MENU on the top-left of your course page and select the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>s and <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s. AFTER you have read the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> and followed the specific directions for what you will submit, select the Main Menu &rarr; Assessment to locate the correct title of the Assessment you wish to submit.</p>
	<p>There are <strong>five</strong> types of Assessments: Workshop, Presentational Speaking, Discussion-Based Assessments, Partial-Graded Quizzes and Pretests/Exams/Auto-Graded Quizzes.</p>
	<p><strong>Workshop</strong> and <strong>Presentation Speaking</strong> assessments are completed offline and submitted through a text box or as an attachment. They are graded by your instructor with detailed feedback.</p>
	<p><strong>Discussion-Based Assessments</strong> are completed with your instructor on the phone (or other synchronous verbal communication methods), while you need to submit them in the course as a proof of your conversation to receive credit. You are usually required to put in the date and time of your conversation with your instructor when you submit. Discussion-Based Assessments are graded by your instructor with detailed feedback.</p>
	<p><strong>Pretests/Exams/Auto-Graded Quizzes</strong> are multiple choice or matching questions that are automatically graded by the system when you click Submit. Exams may require a proctor password for access.</p>
	<p><strong>Partial-Graded Quizzes</strong> are similar to Pretest/Exams/Auto-Graded Quizzes in that they also have multiple choice or matching questions that are automatically graded by the system when you click Submit. Partial-Graded Quizzes also have short answer questions that are graded by your instructor.</p>
	<p>There are two types of Partial-Graded Quizzes: <strong>Quizzes with voice activities and Quizzes with essays.</strong></p>
	<h3>Steps to Submit Your <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name:uc">Assignment</span></h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Read the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name:uc">Lesson</span></strong><br /><br />
			Select the MENU button, and then use the jump menus to access the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.<br /><br />

		<li><strong>Develop/Create your Work</strong><br /><br />
			Teacher-graded or partial-graded assessments may ask you to pre-record an audio, complete a templated worksheet, or write an essay. You should review the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> thoroughly before opening an assessment.</li>
		<li><strong>Access the Assessment</strong><br /><br />
			Select the Assessments button and locate the specific assessment you need to submit.<br /><br />
		<img src="images/assessment_menu.png" alt="Screenshot of the main menu" class="showcase"/></li> 
		<li><strong>Submit your Work</strong><br /><br />
			After you open a teacher-graded or partial-graded assessment, fill in the proper information. Add your text and/or attach your file. Be sure to check the box if you want to submit your work to the Instructor. If you do not check the box, your work will be saved, but not submitted for grading. If you save your work for later, return to the Assessments area and open the same <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> title to continue. IF you are submitting an attachment, it cannot contain a period in the file name. Please use an underscore. (_) For example, an attachment for <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> 3.2 should be titled, 3_2.doc, not 3.2.doc. If you use a period in the file name, your attachment will be lost in the system.<br /><br />

		If the assessment is a pretest/exam/auto-graded quiz, you will be presented with a number of questions to answer. Most exams will allow only one submission so make sure you are prepared to take the exam before you access it. At the bottom of the exam, you MUST click on the check box before you click the Submit button. Your work will not be submitted to the Instructor OR be saved if you forget to check the button. Your submission will be counted as one attempt at the Exam.<br /><br />

	<h3>Quizzes with Voice Activities</h3>
	<p>Some quizzes in the course contain voice activities. For such a quiz you will need to upload your <strong>previously-recorded</strong> voice activity that you completed in the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. Please ensure that you have recorded the voice activity <strong>prior to beginning</strong> the quiz. Then during the quiz, you will select the voice recording and upload it before submitting.</p>
