				<p>It is time to showcase your verbal skills on what you have learned. For this presentation, you will record an audio or a video, speaking in complete sentences in Chinese. Your audio or video should include the grammar and vocabulary from the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s.
					Using <strong>complete sentences in Chinese</strong>, talk about the city in China that you’ve researched in the writing workshop previously in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, for which you have created a simple city map. For this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will select at least two places on that map that you wish to go, describe their locations relative to the places near them, tell what types of transportation you will use to get there, and say what two activities you can do at each of these two places.
