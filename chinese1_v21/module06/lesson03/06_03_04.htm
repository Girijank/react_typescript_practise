<h2>Big Cities, Small Cities</h2>
<br>
<p>Recently Kailan is also working on a school project to compare the downtown areas in megacities in China, such as Beijing and Shanghai, and in small cities or towns. Below are some of her findings. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
               <figure class="wp-caption">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                 <ul>
                   <li>Downtown areas in megacities in China usually have chain shopping malls owned by big
					companies, while in smaller cities or towns, more privately-owned businesses are easily seen.</li>
					<li>Downtown areas in megacities in China usually have tall buildings to accommodate more businesses, while in smaller cities or towns, the buildings are in smaller scale.</li>
					<li>Downtown areas in megacities in China usually have large public buildings such as concert halls or theaters, while in smaller cities or towns, there are entertainment sites such as family restaurants or karaoke bars.</li>
				 </ul>
        
            </div>
        </div>

                 <ul>
					 <li>Downtown areas in megacities in China usually have wider streets and overhead bridges to accommodate heavy pedestrian traffic, while in smaller cities or towns, the streets are narrower and not many overhead bridges are built.</li>
					 <li>There are usually multiple downtown areas in megacities in China for multiple city districts, while in smaller cities or towns, there is usually one downtown area for each city or town.</li>
					 <li>Presently the smaller cities or towns in China are developing fast, and they are “copying” the downtown layouts in megacities and expanding the scales of businesses and buildings.</li>

				<h2>Apply It!</h2>
				<p>Now that you have seen what the downtown area is like in a typical city in China, how is it similar to or different from your own? Now it’s time to explore the downtown in your area and compare it with that of Kailan. Find a weekend and invite your family to go for a stroll with you in the downtown area in your city. Identify what businesses, stores, or buildings there are, and compare them with Kailan’s. Have you found similar buildings, and what is the biggest difference that you find between the two downtown areas? Share your findings with your family members as you are strolling down the streets in your downtown.</p>
