		<!--<p><strong>Senior Pastimes in My Community</strong></p>-->
        <p><span lang="zh-Hans">西单</span> Xīdān (Xidan) has hundreds of years of history. It originated from Xidan Archway, a small business area, and started booming in the 1900s. It has since developed many stores and businesses. Now <span lang="zh-Hans">西单</span> Xīdān (Xidan) is known as the “Shopping Heaven for the Youth.” It has many trendy and modern places young people can enjoy. Below are some places I often go to:</p>

        <ul>
