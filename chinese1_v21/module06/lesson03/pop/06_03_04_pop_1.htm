        <h2>City Districts in My City</h2>
        <hr />

        <!--<p><strong>Senior Pastime in My Community</strong></p>-->
       <p>My city, Beijing, is the capital of the People’s Republic of China. It has sixteen administrative districts, among which are six city districts, such as <span lang="zh-Hans">东城区</span> Dōngchéng qū (Dongcheng District), <span lang="zh-Hans">西城区</span> Xīchéng qū (Xicheng District), and <span lang="zh-Hans">海淀区</span> Hǎidiàn qū (Haidian District).</p>

       <p>Each city district has its own downtown area with similar layouts and buildings. I live in <span lang="zh-Hans">西城区</span> Xīchéng qū (Xicheng District). The downtown in this district, which is near to my home, is called <span lang="zh-Hans">西单</span> Xīdān (Xidan).</p>
