	  <p>It’s now time to see what you’ve learned in action. Watch the dialogue video to see how the vocabulary and structures you’ve learned so far can be used in real-life settings; then you can apply them in your own daily life. </p>

			<h2>Helpful Hint</h2>
			<p>When viewing the dialogue videos in this course, remember:</p>
	 
				<ul>
					<li>Watch each video twice. First, listen through it to see how much you can initially understand. Pay attention to the context and non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements.</li>
					<li>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything during the first viewing. Make use of the closed captioning to help you understand. Pause the video when necessary so you can have a full view of the sentences in characters or pinyin.</li>	
					<li>Feel free to speak along with the dialogue in the video. This will help you build a strong sense of intonations, pronunciations, and cadence in Chinese speech.</li>	
					<li>Read the comprehension questions beforehand. Keep the questions in mind while watching the video.</li>	
					<li>Answer the questions in your note guide, and then check your answers.</li>
					<li><strong>Note</strong>: You will have similar questions on the assessments, so be sure to take the time to practice now.</li>
				</ul>

									<p>Zhang Ming suggested going by walking first, and then taking bus two routes. Then Chen Lili suggested taking a taxi. Next, Zhang Ming suggested getting there by riding bikes. Of the three, the most expensive is taking a taxi, for which Zhang Ming expressed that he may not have enough money. Riding bikes is likely the least expensive since it’s what Zhang Ming suggested right after the taxi idea. </p>
