		<h1><span lang="zh-Hans">公路旅行</span> Gōnglù lǚxíng Road Signs for Road Trips</h1>

		<p>Do you wonder what different road or traffic signs look like in Chinese-speaking regions? Are they all in Chinese characters? Now let’s look at some examples by playing the matching game below. Let’s see how well you can do with the knowledge you have so far. The characters, or the shapes and colors on the signs may also give you some hints.</p>

		<div class="ng_il drag_1" data-json="interactives/06_06_07_1/data.json" data-mWidth="700px" data-mHeight="300px"></div>

    <p>Now you are almost there to be able to discuss destinations and how to get there, using complete sentences in Chinese. Before you can put things in action, let’s learn some grammar points.</p>
<br>
	<div class="tabs" data-position="left">
		<a class="tab" title="Using <span lang='zh-Hans'>怎么</span> zěnme (how) to ask for directions">Using <span lang='zh-Hans'>怎么</span> zěnme (how) to ask for directions</a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p><span lang='zh-Hans'>怎么</span> zěnme (how), when used in a sentence, should be placed right <strong>before</strong> the verb. You will need this for your writing <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> later this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.</p>

		<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><span lang="zh-Hans">你们<strong>怎么</strong>去图书馆</span>？Nǐmen <strong>zěnme</strong> qù túshūguǎn? <br> How do you go to the library?</li>
			<li><span lang="zh-Hans">去博物馆<strong>怎么</strong>走</span>？Qù bówùguǎn <strong>zěnme</strong> zǒu?
				<br> How do I get to the museum?</li>
		</ul>
			
		</div>
		<!--End tab #1-->

		<a class="tab" title="Saying address in Chinese">Saying address in Chinese</a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>When saying an address in Chinese, remember the rule of going from <strong>big</strong> to <strong>small</strong>, which is the opposite of saying an address in English.</p>

         <p>city + <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">市</span> shì</strong> + road + <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">路</span> lù</strong> + house number + <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">号</span> hào</strong></p>

		 <p><strong>Note </strong>:</p>
		 
		 <ul>
			 <li>You can add more information such as country, province, and district if needed, all in order from big to small.</li>
			 <li>You will learn more address-related words in the future, such as “province,” “drive,” “boulevard,” and “zip code.”</li>
			 <li>For the names of cities or roads in English, you can simply write them in English. </li>
		 </ul>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			
			<p>Orlando <span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>市</strong></span> Bluestar <span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>路</strong>三十八<strong>号</strong></span> Orlando <strong>shì</strong> Bluestar <strong>lù</strong> sānshíbā <strong>hào</strong> (#38 Bluestar Road, Orlando City)</p>
			<p><strong>Note</strong>: For the house number, you can also write it in numeral form instead of Chinese characters.</p>

		<a class="tab" title="Describing destination and transportation in a sentence">Describing destination and transportation in a sentence </a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Let’s write complete sentences to describe how to get somewhere by following the structure below. You will need this for your writing <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> later in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.</p>

			<p>Subject + <span lang="zh-Hans">坐</span> zuò/<span lang="zh-Hans">骑</span> qí + transportation + <span lang="zh-Hans">去</span> qù (to go to) + destination</p>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我们<strong>坐</strong>出租车<strong>去</strong>医院。</span>Wǒmen <strong>zuò</strong> chūzūchē <strong>qù</strong> yīyuàn. (We <strong>ride</strong> the taxi <strong>to</strong> the hospital.)</li>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">她姐姐<strong>骑</strong>单车<strong>去</strong>学校。</span>Tā jǐjie <strong>qí</strong> dānchē <strong>qù</strong> xuéxiào. (Her older sister <strong>rides</strong> the bike <strong>to</strong> the school.)</li>
				
			</ul>

	<p>Let’s also see how you apply what you just learned verbally. Listen to the audio. It’s Saturday morning, and Jiajun is going to show his friend around town. Jiajun’s mom is giving him directions on how to get to different places. A text version of the audio has been provided for support, but see how much you can understand without the use of text. </p>

	<div id="d2" class="collapse ">
		<div class="card-action cwhite black-text">
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">你们上午可以坐地铁去市中心，再坐巴士去电影院，再走路去餐厅吃饭。下午可以坐火车去乡下，骑单车去看农场。晚上坐出租车回家吃晚餐。</span></p>
			<p>Nǐmen shàngwǔ kěyǐ zuò dìtiě qù shìzhōngxīn, zài zuò bāshì qù diànyǐngyuàn, zài zǒulù qù cāntīng chīfàn. Xiàwǔ kěyǐ zuò huǒchē qù xiāngxià, qí dānchē qù kàn nóngchǎng. Wǎnshàng zuò chūzūchē huíjiā chī wǎncān.</p>
			<p>You can take the subway to downtown in the morning, then take the bus to the movie theater, and then walk to the restaurant to eat. In the afternoon, you can ride the train to the countryside, and then ride a bike to look at the farm. In the evening, you can take the taxi to come back home for dinner.</p>
