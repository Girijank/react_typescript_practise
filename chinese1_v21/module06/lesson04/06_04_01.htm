				<p>You have done very well moving forward in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. You are almost done with the whole course. What an
					achievement! By now you’ve learned how to identify and describe different facilities or businesses in your community
					and city. You can also identify different pastimes and activities at these locations. Plus, you’ve added several new
					treasures to your repertoire of preposition words. Your vocabulary and knowledge of grammar and culture continue to
					grow in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. Way to go!</p>
				
				<p>Earlier in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you watched a dialogue video to see how Chinese works in the speaking world. Now let’s review the

		<p>Have you ever been to a city or community in China? If so, have you used a map in Chinese to help you get around
			town? If not, maybe there is a city in China that you would like to visit, and you might want to create a map for it so
			you can plan ahead. In a typical city map in Chinese, the layout of the area is shown, and various places in the area are
			pointed out and labeled, using Chinese characters. Now let’s get some preparation work done, and get things going. By
			the end of this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will have a nice map of your destination city in China ready for use, all in Chinese!
