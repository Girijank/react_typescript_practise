          <p>Now let’s put these characters into action. You will create a simple map of a city in China that you wish to visit and label various places on the map, based on one of the choices provided below. You will then write three sentences in Chinese
            to describe these places, using prepositions and what you wish to do there. </p>

          <p>Before creating your own, review the provided <button type="button" class="btn-default fev_singleddbtn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer1"><strong>sample city map in Chinese</strong></button> on this page. This is a map in Chinese for a small city. It is for your reference, and you will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on the new words in this sample map. Yours will be similar to this but simpler.</p>

          <div id="answer1" class="collapse">

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>When creating the city map, you can use the characters taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> and/or the characters you have learned
            previously.</p>

          <p>Use the <a href="docs/my_community_workshop_template.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" target="_blank"> <strong><span class="module_name_tag"></span> Workshop Template</strong></a> for your work. In the template, there is a bank of icons and labels under the
            map area for you to use. Remember that these icons and labels can be duplicated and moved onto the map area, and
            then you can put labels next to them. You will then type or write the names of the places in Chinese characters within
            the label frame. On the side of the template, there are also some lined components that you can use to form streets or
            roads on your map.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure to do your research on the city or town in China that you wish to visit, and find the places of interest in
        that city or town. You can choose the appropriate icons from the bank and label them appropriately, using Chinese
        characters. </p>

      <p>On the second page of your work, you will also need to write three sentences to describe three places of interest you
        have labeled on the map. For each place, describe its location using a preposition word, and describe the appropriate
        activities that you plan to do there. </p>

      <p>Use the <a href="docs/resources_preposition_words_review.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" target="_blank"> <strong>Preposition Words Review</strong></a> to review all the preposition words you’ve learned in this course.</p>


      <p>Use the <a href="docs/resources_pastimes_and_activities_review.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" target="_blank"> <strong>Pastimes and Activities Review</strong></a> to review all leisure-time activities you have learned in this course. </p>

      <p>You can also use your own design, or look online for an existing template that you like. Again, remember that you can
        “customize” the template of your choice by adding or removing the components to suit your own situation. Enjoy the
        activity!

          <h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario A</h2>
          <p>Create a simple map for a small town in China that you wish to visit. Your map should include at least six icons and their labels in Chinese characters. Then write three sentences to describe three places you have labeled on the map. For each place, describe its location using a preposition word, and describe what you wish to do there. </p>

          <h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario B</h2>
          <p>Create a map for the downtown area of a city in China that you wish to visit. Your map should include at least six icons and their labels in Chinese characters. Then write three sentences to describe three places you have labeled on the map. For each place, describe its location using a preposition word, and describe what you wish to do there.</p>

        </div>
      </div>


      <p>Complete the contents of the map, using the appropriate characters from the demonstrations on the “Writing Chinese Characters” page and/or any other characters you have learned previously. You can choose to handwrite the characters or type the characters directly onto a word document, and then save the document as your work.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure to type or handwrite the characters in the worksheet instead of copying and pasting them from the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. You are encouraged to handwrite the characters when possible. It is the best way to understand the characters. </li>
        <li>For this activity, you can also consider using the characters you’ve learned and used in the previous workshops, wherever you see it applicable.</li>

          <h2>Be Adventurous</h2>
          <p>You are encouraged to research various cities or towns in China that you can visit. Don’t limit yourself to the few well-known metropolitan cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai. Take the time to explore other areas in China, and there are plenty of “hidden treasures” in the vast nation just there waiting for you.</p>
