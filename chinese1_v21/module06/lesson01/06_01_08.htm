Many apartment communities provide rooms in their activity centers where residents can play mahjong, chess, or other board games, such as poker or checker games.

						<p>A fun way to get people together in communities in China is playing music. Many apartment communities provide indoor or outdoor sites where residents can play music together. Senior people like to play Chinese traditional music, while the younger generation enjoys playing pop music. Singing karaoke is another musical activity enjoyed by residents of all ages. Such sites are usually equipped with stereo systems and televisions, and many community events, such as parties or meetings, can be held there. Weather permitting, residents also enjoy playing music or singing in outdoor pavilions or verandas.</p>
