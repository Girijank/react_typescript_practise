				<p>Beijing (<span lang="zh-Hans">北京</span> Běijīng), China’s capital city, is a place where ancient China meets the ever-growing modern
					innovations, a place of contrast and constant change. It is a city where you can go to the top floor of a
					contemporary skyscraper and peek into the past as you glimpse a view of ancient cultures and landmarks like
					the Temple of Heaven and the Forbidden City. A massive place with more than 21 million people may seem a
					little overwhelming, but the residents are known for being very welcoming. Let’s learn a little more about
					bustling Beijing before moving on to the last <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> in this course.

							<p>There are so many amazing sites to see in Beijing that you could take a whole course on it! So here is a quick must-see list for the next time you travel to Beijing:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Forbidden City</strong>: It is a formerly restricted imperial palace complex from old China that is now a public museum.</li>
								<li><strong>Tiananmen Square</strong>: This is one of the most important, largest, and most famous squares in the world. It is famous for mass protests and national celebrations.</li>
								<li><strong>Temple of Heaven</strong>: An ancient building once used in sacrifices and a historical place of worship, it sits high behind a high wall.</li>

							<p>Another example of the cultural and historical contrasts are the old lanes of the Beijing hutongs—lanes or alleys formed by traditional courtyard compounds lining both sides—called "siheyuan" (<span lang="zh-Hans">四合院</span> sìhéyuàn). These hutongs range from little alleys 40 centimeters wide to streets 10 meters wide, with old buildings arranged on four sides around a courtyard. The buildings and the courtyard are enclosed by a wall.</p>
							<p>The hutong streets and alleys crisscross with
								each other and meander in confusing ways.
								They have descriptive names that tell their
								origin, location, or history. Beijing still has about
								400,000 residential siheyuans that are mainly in
								the East, West, Xuanwu, and Chongwen
								districts. </p>

							<p>Beijing’s subway is the country’s busiest form of transportation, with 10 million people using it each weekday. They even have announcements in both English and Chinese; however, you may want to stay off the subway during peak hours.</p>
							<p>Since the capital city is mostly flat, it makes it perfect for grabbing a bike to get around. Though the city, once nicknamed the “Kingdom of Bicycles,” is past its peak cycling years; recent years have seen an explosion in bike rentals.</p>
							<p>Don’t feel like doing all the work? Grab a rickshaw! More expensive than taking a taxi, it allows tourists to enjoy the street scene at a leisurely pace and avoid traffic jams. Rickshaws can always be found at hubs in the city center and the tourist area.</p>

							<p>As you have learned in previous <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>s, the official national language of China is Mandarin, sometimes called Modern Standard Chinese, and it is considered the official language of administration, of the classics, and of education. While throughout much of mainland China people speak their own local flavor of Chinese for everyday communication, they've all been educated in Mandarin, which, in general terms, is the formal language of the nation. </p>
							<p>The Chinese spoken among Beijing people is similar to formal Mandarin with slight variations. Later in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you will learn about these variations. </p>
