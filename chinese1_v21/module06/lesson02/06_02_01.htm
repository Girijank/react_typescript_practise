				<p>You’ve just learned to describe different places or businesses in a community. How wonderful! You’ve also learned how
					to describe places you’ve been to using Chinese, and you’ve learned about popular places in Chinese communities. Now
					let’s focus on pastime activities you can do at these places. Imagine you are talking with your friend about your weekend
					plans. How do you tell your friend that you are going shopping or to a concert, and how do you describe some exercises
					you will do, such as jogging or swimming? We’ll learn all of this. Now you can touch on more topics when conversing with
					a friend from China, and you can share more with each other!</p>
