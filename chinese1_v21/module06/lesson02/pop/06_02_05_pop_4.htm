	     <ul>
             <li>There are many things to do outdoors in my community. My older brother goes hiking every weekend. My friends and I skateboard at the local park. Sometimes we do street dancing as well.</li>
             <li>My family and I enjoy outdoor activities. We take a camping trip into the mountains once a year.</li>
             <li>People sing karaoke sometimes. But itâ€™s not very popular.</li>
             <li>When my friend and I hang out indoors, we usually play videogames or play music together. We have a band, and I play drums.</li>
