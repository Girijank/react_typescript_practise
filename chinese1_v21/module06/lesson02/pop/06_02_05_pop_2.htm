          <ul>
              <li>Seniors in my community usually go to the senior center to attend various activities. Bingo games are popular in my city.</li>
              <li>My grandma attends an exercise group where they do moderate exercising on a weekly basis. My grandpa attends a hiking club. They often hike the local trails.</li>
               <li>My grandma also attends a jewelry-making group. They get together every Tuesday, make jewelry, and donate it to the community. </li>
               <li>My grandpaâ€™s in a book club. He now reads a book every two weeks and discusses the books with his friends at their gatherings.</li>
