        <p><strong>Senior Pastime in My Community</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Seniors in my community enjoy outdoor activities that are mostly moderate and relaxing, such as tai chi, which sometimes involves the use of a Chinese sword with dull blades for safety.</li>
        <li>Seniors in my community like to play shuttlecock, a traditional toy usually made with poultry feathers fixed on top of a coin. The player kicks the toy in the air with different tricks and keeps it from falling to the ground.</li>
        <li>The hobby of keeping birds is a tradition in my city also. It started during the Qing dynasty (1644â€“1911). People usually hold birdcages with their pet birds chirping inside and stroll the streets in the morning. </li>
