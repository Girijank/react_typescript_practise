	  <p>Now it’s time to put all we’ve learned into action. Let’s watch a video to see how vocabulary words and phrases are used
		in an actual conversation. This also means that you will now be able to practice everything for your own use in your
		everyday life.</p>

			<h2>Helpful Hint</h2>
			<P>When viewing the dialogue videos in this course, remember:</P>
	 
				<ul>
					<li>Watch each video twice. First, listen through it to see how much you can initially understand. Pay attention to
						the context and non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements.</li>
					<li>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything during the first viewing. Make use of the closed captioning to
						help you understand. Pause the video when necessary so you can have a full view of the sentences in characters
						or pinyin.</li>	
					<li>Feel free to speak along with the dialogue in the video. This will help you build a strong sense of intonations,
						pronunciations, and cadences of Chinese speech</li>	
					<li>Read the comprehension questions beforehand. Keep the questions in mind while watching the video.</li>	
					<li>Answer the questions in your note guide, and then check your answers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will have similar questions on the assessments, so be sure to take the time to practice now.</p>
