		<h1><span lang="zh-Hans">保持健康</span> Bǎochí jiànkāng Keeping Fit</h1>

		<p>Let’s learn more vocabulary on activities that will keep you in shape. It’s time to get active!</p>

		<!-- <p>Select the image to see the word or phrase. Listen to the audio and then practice by recording yourself pronouncing what you hear. Practice as many times as you need to sound like a native speaker!</p> -->

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pay attention to the characters that are in <span
			class="fev_darkredout"><strong>bold type and highlighted in dark red</strong></span>. You will learn to write them later in the <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. The characters  <span class="fev_greyout">highlighted in slate grey</span> are from the previous <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>(s). You should continue practicing them. For characters not in bold type or highlighted, feel free to practice writing them in your note guide, but remember that for now, you will only need to know how to write the bold or highlighted characters.</p>

					<h2>Notes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The word “to play” in Chinese takes various forms, depending on what you are playing. In sports, you often use the
							verb <span lang="zh-Hans">打</span> dǎ (to hit), such as <span lang="zh-Hans">打乒乓球</span> dǎ pīngpāngqiú (to play ping-pong). It is also used for sports that mostly
							involve balls such as volleyball, basketball, badminton, tennis, and American football. However, the soccer ball is an
							exception, for which you need to use <span lang="zh-Hans">踢</span> tī (to kick).</li>
						<li>The word <span lang="zh-Hans">运动</span> yùndòng (to exercise/fitness/sports) can be used as a verb itself. It can also be used as a noun, when
							the verb to be used with it is <span lang="zh-Hans">做</span> zuò (to do). So you can say both <span lang="zh-Hans">运动</span> yùndòng and <span lang="zh-Hans">做运动</span> zuòyùndòng for “to do
							exercise.”</li>	
						<li>The word <span lang="zh-Hans">吗</span> ma (question particle) is a particle placed at the end of a statement to turn it into a question. The
							character itself doesn’t have any meaning.</li>

			<P>Remember the Chinese idiom <span lang="zh-Hans">曙光在前</span> shǔguāngzàiqián? (The dawn is right ahead.) Each step you are moving forward,
				you are getting closer to the light of dawn. Let’s practice on the last group of vocabulary words in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> that you’ve
				just learned.</P>
