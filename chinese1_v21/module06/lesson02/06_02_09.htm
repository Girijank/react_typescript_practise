				<h2>The W’s</h2>
				<p>When describing an activity with information such as where, when, who, or with whom in a Chinese sentence, you need
					to go in the order of “<strong>Who + with whom + when + where + doing what</strong>.” Remember the “when” doesn’t go at the end
					like in English. You will need this information to complete your voice activity later in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>.<br>
					Select each part of the example sentence to see the order in action!
					</p>
				<p><strong>Example </strong>:</p>	
				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto"
					data-content='who' data-trigger="click">我</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='with whom' data-trigger="click">和我妹妹</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='when' data-trigger="click">下午三点</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='where' data-trigger="click">在公园</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='doing what' data-trigger="click">散步。</a></span>Wǒ hé wǒ mèimei xiàwǔ sāndiǎn zài gōngyuán sànbù. (My younger sister and I walk at the park at 3 p.m.)</p>
				<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto"
					data-content='who' data-trigger="click">他</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='with whom' data-trigger="click">和他朋友</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='when' data-trigger="click">星期六上午</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='where' data-trigger="click">在活动中心</a><a class="popover" data-html="true" data-position="left auto" data-content='doing what' data-trigger="click">打乒乓球。</a></span>Tā hé tā péngyǒu xīngqīliù shàngwǔ zài huódòngzhōngxīn dǎ pīngpāngqiú. (He and his friends play ping-pong at the activity center on Saturday morning.)</p>

		<p>Do you wonder how to ask someone what pastime they like? It’s actually very simple, so let’s get to it now.</p>
		<br> 
		<div class="tabs">
			<a class="tab" title="A question with <span lang='zh-Hans'>吗</span> ma">A question with <span lang='zh-Hans'>吗</span> ma</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Do you know that you can change a sentence into a question simply by adding <span lang="zh-Hans">吗</span> ma? To do that, you simply add it at the end of a sentence, and change the period to a question mark. </p>
	
			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">今天很热。</span>JĪntiān hěn rè. <br> It’s very hot today.</li>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">今天很热<strong>吗</strong></span>？JĪntiān hěn rè <strong>ma</strong>? <br> Is it very hot today?</li>
			</ul>
				
			</div>
			<!--End tab #1-->
	
			<a class="tab" title="A tag question with <span lang='zh-Hans'>吗</span> ma">A tag question with  <span lang="zh-Hans">吗</span> ma</a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>A <strong>tag question</strong> is a question that is converted from a statement, asking for confirmation. For example, “It’s hot today, isn’t it?” </p>
				<p>Use the following structure to form a <strong>tag question</strong> in Chinese:</p>
				<p>Statement, <span lang="zh-Hans">好hǎo/是shì/可以kěyǐ + 吗</span>？</p>
	
				<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><span lang="zh-Hans">今天很热。</span>JĪntiān hěn rè. <br> It’s very hot today.</li>
					<li><span lang="zh-Hans">今天很热，<strong>是吗</strong></span>？Jīntiān hěn rè, <strong>shì ma</strong>?<br> It is very hot today, <strong>isn’t it</strong>?</li>
				</ul>					   
			</div>
			<!--End tab #2-->

			<a class="tab" title="When to use which ">When to use which </a>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>You will use one of the four words <span lang="zh-Hans">好 hǎo/是 shì/可 以 kěyǐ with 吗 </span>ma, depending on the nature of your tag question. </p>
	
				<!--<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>-->
				
				<ul>
					<li><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>好</strong>吗</span>？hǎo ma? – “okay?”<br>
						<strong>For example </strong>:<br>
						<span lang="zh-Hans">我们去散步，<strong>好吗</strong></span>？Wǒmen qù sànbù, <strong>hǎo ma</strong>?<br> Let’s go for a walk, <strong>okay</strong>?<br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>是</strong>吗</span>？<strong>shì</strong> ma? – “isn’t it?” (or similar tag questions)<br>
						<strong>For example </strong>:<br>
						<span lang="zh-Hans">她喜欢独处，<strong>是吗</strong></span>？Tā xǐhuān dúchǔ, <strong>shì ma</strong>? <br> She likes to spend time alone, doesn’t she?<br><br></li>
				
					<li><span lang="zh-Hans"><strong>可以</strong>吗</span>？<strong>kěyǐ</strong> ma? – “may I” (ask for permission)<br>
						<strong>For example </strong>:<br>
						<span lang="zh-Hans">妈妈，我想吃蛋糕，<strong>可以吗</strong></span>？Māma, wǒ xiàng chī dàngāo, <strong>kěyǐ ma</strong>?<br> Mom, I want to eat cake, <strong>may I</strong>?
					</li>
