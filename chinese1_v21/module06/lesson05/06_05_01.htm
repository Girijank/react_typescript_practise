			<p>Did you enjoy mapping out a community in Chinese in the previous <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? You’ve done an amazing job showcasing your writing and map skills. Now it’s time to put your verbal skills into action. Yes, we will have a conversation—in Chinese. You will have a discussion-based conversation with your instructor to showcase your learning.</p>

			<p>What do you need? When you contact your instructor, be sure to have a method to do a two-way audio/video
				exchange. What will you do or say? Easy—you'll show off your interpersonal and interpretive communication skills by
				engaging in an instructor-directed chat. And you have an opportunity to ask your instructor questions. Don't worry; you
				can take notes to use, so you know what you want to say and ask and how to respond.</p>

			<p>Let's cover the specific requirements for your discussion so you can knock this out. During your Discussion-Based
				Assessment, you will use Chinese to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>actively participate in a basic conversation about places and activities around your community in Chinese</li>
				<li>actively participate in a simulated conversation between two students talking about what to do at different places in the community</li>
				<li>ask for and give directions to different places in a community in order to solve problems or complete tasks</li>
			</ul>

	  <p>During the conversation, your instructor may ask additional questions about the Chinese language and culture. These questions may be asked and answered verbally in English, especially when it involves the Chinese culture.</p>
