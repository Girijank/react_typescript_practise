		<h1><span lang="zh-Hans">写汉字</span> Xiě Hànzì Writing Chinese Characters</h1>

		<p>It’s now time to see how the writing rules apply. Below is a demonstration of how some familiar characters
			are written, stroke by stroke. There are 15 characters in the demonstration, which you will use in your
			writing at the end of this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. In the demonstration, you will also find a sample word or sentence in
			which the character is used.</p>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use this <a href="docs/module_1_characters_spreadsheet.pdf" role="button" target="_blank" class="fev_downloadbtn">
			<!-- <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download"></span> -->
		<strong>worksheet</strong></a> to view <strong>all</strong> the characters you’ve
			learned so far. You can practice them if you are interested.</p>
