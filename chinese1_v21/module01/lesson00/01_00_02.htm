The key to success is using various resources to learn but completing tasks and <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span>s on your own. Take a look at these helpful hints for more!</p>

							<p>Many words have multiple meanings. Take the word “fill” for example. It can be used as a
								verb, such as: “They fill the bottles” or “He is filling the position.” It can be also
								used as a noun, for example: “I ate my fill” or “The dentist gave him a filling.”</p>
							<p>To avoid making mistakes when using a language dictionary, pay attention to context and
								parts of speech such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.</p>

							<p>Writing is a great way to get comfortable in using and thinking in a new language. So,
								when you need to write an <span class="lang" data-term="assignment_name">assignment</span> in a foreign language, it’s best to start with a
								short outline <em>in that language</em>. Bonus: this will also save you time since
								you’re only
								writing one version.</p>
							<p>Save even more time and effort with these foreign-language writing tips:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Keep your sentences simple.</li>
								<li>Use vocabulary found in your course.</li>
								<li>When responding to a question, use the terms in the question to form your response.
								</li>
								<li>If you need help, ask your instructor.</li>

							<p>Have you ever used a translator on a web page in another language? If so, you know that

									<p class="text-center">A translator may say:<br />

							<p>We get it. Learning a new language can be really uncomfortable at first. You might feel
								silly or awkward saying new words, but the only way to get better is through practice.
							</p>
							<p>Whenever you can, pronounce the words and phrases you are learning out loud to build your
								confidence. Listening also goes a long way to help boost your foreign language
								confidence, whether it’s course material, a podcast, or a foreign language film.</p>
							<p>Just be sure to listen intentionally and try to identify words and phrases you’re
								learning throughout your course.</p>
