				<p>It’s very important in the Chinese culture to know how to properly address people in formal
					occasions. People are usually addressed by their <strong>titles</strong> in non-professional social
					gatherings, such as weddings or banquets and by their <strong>professions</strong> in professional
					meetings, such as doctor’s appointments or academic conferences.</p>

				<p>In Chinese, people’s names (can be either last name or full name) are placed before the title or
					profession, not after. </p>

				<h4>Here Comes the Bride:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>In mainland China, women usually keep their maiden name after marriage and don’t take their
						husband’s last name.</li>
					<li>They should be addressed by their maiden name when using professions and titles. For example,
						when a female teacher in China <span lang="zh-Hans">王老师</span> Wáng Lǎoshī (Teacher Wang) gets
						married, she is still called <span lang="zh-Hans">王老师</span> Wáng Lǎoshī (Teacher Wang).</li>
					<li>In some regions like Hong Kong or Macau, married women add their husband’s last name before
						their maiden name, and in that case, they should be addressed by their husband’s last name. For
						example, if a woman from Hong Kong whose maiden name was <span lang="zh-Hans">刘</span> liú gets
						married to a guy whose last name is <span lang="zh-Hans">李</span> Lǐ, then the woman’s last name
						is changed to <span lang="zh-Hans">刘李</span> Liú Lǐ, </li>
