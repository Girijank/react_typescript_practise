		<p>It’s now time to see what you’ve learned in action. Watch the dialogue video to see how the vocabulary and
			structures you’ve learned so far can be used in real life settings; then you can apply them in your daily
			life.</p>

				<h2>Helpful Hint</h2>
				<p>When viewing the dialogue videos in this course, remember:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Watch each video twice. First, listen through it to see how much you can initially understand.
						Pay attention to the context and non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and
						body movements.</li>
					<li>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything during the first viewing. Make use of the closed
						captioning to help you understand. Pause the video when necessary so you can have a full view of
						the sentences in characters or pinyin.</li>
					<li>Feel free to speak along with the dialogue in the video. This will help you build a strong sense
						of intonations, pronunciations, and cadence in Chinese speech.</li>
					<li>Read the comprehension questions beforehand. Keep the questions in mind while watching the
						video.</li>
					<li>Answer the questions in your note guide and then check your answers. <strong>Note</strong>: You
						will have similar questions on the assessments, so be sure to take the time to practice now.
					</li>
				</ul>
