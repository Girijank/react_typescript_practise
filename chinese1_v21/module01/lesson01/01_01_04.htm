	  <p>Did you know that there are no <a class="popover" data-position="left auto" data-html="true"
		data-content="Words in different languages that share the same root or origin" data-title="Cognates"
		data-trigger="click">cognates</a> between Chinese and English? That is why it may be a little more challenging for English speakers to learn Chinese—you’ll need to learn everything from scratch. Ugh! (Yet you are doing very well so far.)</p>
		
		<p>But no worries. Throughout years of development and interactions with other languages and cultures, people have accumulated plenty of <a class="popover" data-position="left auto" data-html="true"
			data-content=" A word that was borrowed from another language" data-title="Loan words"
			data-trigger="click">loan words</a> in Chinese that we can totally rely on. For example, when friends first meet, instead of saying the formal “<span lang="zh-Hans">你好</span> Nǐhǎo (Hello),” you can also say <span lang="zh-Hans">嗨</span> Hài, which is simply the word “hi” said in Chinese way. The same for <span lang="zh-Hans">拜拜</span> Baibai, which is the pronunciation for “bye-bye” in English.</p>

		<p>Loan words, especially those from the English language, are widely used in all Chinese-speaking regions. Let’s look at some more examples of such loan words below. See if you can catch them all. Remember, they all sound almost the same as their English counterparts. Doesn’t that make life a little easier?</p>
