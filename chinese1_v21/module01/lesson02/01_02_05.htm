		<p>Information overload? Let’s take a short break, and stroll through states of the U.S.</p>

		<P>Saying names of U.S. states in Chinese is straightforward. They are translations by sound, followed by the
			word <span lang="zh-Hans">州</span> zhōu, meaning “state.” For example, Florida would be <span
				lang="zh-Hans">佛罗里达州</span> Fóluólǐdá zhōu (<span lang="zh-Hans">州</span> zhōu -- state). Sounds
			similar, right? Please don’t worry about memorizing these Chinese translations; let’s just concentrate on
			their pronunciations for now. This is also the same case for the names of most cities in English. The name
			of the city in Chinese pronunciation is followed by the word <span lang="zh-Hans">市</span> shì meaning
			“city;” for example, <span lang="zh-Hans">坦帕市</span> Tǎnpà shì means “Tampa city.”</P>

		<p>Now let’s play a fun game by simply listening to the names of U.S. states in Chinese, then dragging them to
			their appropriate place on the map. It’s time to test out your geographic knowledge as well!</p>
