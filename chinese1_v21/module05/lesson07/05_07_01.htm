      <p>It is time to showcase your verbal skills on what you have learned. For this presentation, you will record an audio or a video, speaking in complete sentences in Chinese. Your audio or video should include the grammar and vocabulary from the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>lessons.</p>
      <p>Using <strong>complete sentences in Chinese,</strong> talk about a Chinese home and compare it with a home in the United States. Research and describe one of the five types of Chinese homes you learned about previously in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. Talk about it as if it were the home of your friend living in China. Then, talk about the home in the United States, based on the dream house plan you have created in the workshop for this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. You will compare the two homes regarding their types, compositions, and interior furniture items.</p>
