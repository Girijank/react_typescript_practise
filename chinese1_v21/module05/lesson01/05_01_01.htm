				<p>Fantastic job moving forward in the second <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span> of this course. You are doing very well so far! Now let the fun continue—you are now going to learn how to describe your home sweet home, using Chinese.</p>
				<p>Imagine you have house guests coming from China, and you want to give them a grand tour of your home. How will you introduce different parts of your house, what rooms there are, and what functions they have? Can you describe the rooms’ locations so your house guests can get around easily (such as finding the bathroom)? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will be equipped with these practical skills. You may be using them before you know it.</p>
