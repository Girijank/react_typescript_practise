			<p>Nice job learning the words on types of houses, different parts of a house, and some preposition words. Now it’s time to put them together to inquire about and describe your home sweet home. Let’s get going.</p>

		<a class="tab" title="Inquire about the Composition of a House">Inquire about the Composition of a House</a>

			<p>Remember <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">多少</span> duōshǎo (how many)</strong> and <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">几</span> jǐ (how many (answered with small numbers))</strong> that you learned previously to inquire about phone numbers or ages? They can also be used to ask about the composition of a house.</p>

		<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><span lang="zh-Hans">你的公寓有</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">几</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">个卧室？</span>Nǐ de gōngyù yǒu jǐgè wòshì? <br>
			<strong>How many</strong> bedrooms does your family’s house have?</li>
			
			<li><span lang="zh-Hans">他家的大房子有</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">多少</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">个阳台？</span>Tājiā de dàfángzi yǒu <strong>duōshǎo</strong> gè yángtá? <br>
			<strong>How many</strong> balconies does his family’s big house have?</li>		
		</ul>

		<a class="tab" title="Describing the Existence of Houses or Rooms">Describing the Existence of Houses or Rooms</a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Remember <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">有</span> yǒu (to have)</strong> that you learned previously to describe your family members? It can also be used to describe the existence of your house and rooms.</p>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我家的房子</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">有一</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">个车库。</span>Wǒjiā de fángzi <strong>yǒu</strong> yīgè chēkù. <br>
				 My family’s house <strong>has</strong> a garage.</li>
				
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">她的公寓</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">有</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">两个阳台。</span>Tā de gōngyù <strong>yǒu</strong> liǎnggè yángtái. <br>
				Her apartment has two balconies.</li>		
			</ul>
    
			<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
			<p>The measure word <span lang="zh-Hans">个</span> gè is universally used when describing the
				quantity of an object. There are many more measure words you can
				use for specific objects. You will learn all about them in the future. </p>

		<a class="tab" title="Describing the Locations of Houses or Rooms">Describing the Locations of Houses or Rooms</a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Remember <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">在</span> zài (in/on/at)</strong> that you learned previously to describe where you live? It can also be used to describe the location of your house or rooms.</p>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我姐姐的公寓</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">在</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">三楼。</span>Wǒ jiějie de gōngyù <strong>zài</strong> sānlóu. <br>
				My older sister’s apartment is <strong>on</strong> the third floor.</li>
				
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我(的)卧室的门</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">在</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">左边，窗户</span><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">在</span></strong><span lang="zh-Hans">右边。</span>Wǒ (de) wòshì de mén zài zuǒbiān, chuānghù zài yòubiān. <br>
				In my bedroom, the door is <strong>on</strong> the left, and the window is <strong>on</strong> the right.</li>		
			</ul>
    
			<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
			<p>Later in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you will learn how to use preposition words to
				describe relative locations of furniture items in your house.</p>

		<!--End tab #3-->

		<a class="tab" title="More Examples">More Examples</a>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Let’s look at a few pairs of questions and answers, using the previously
				discussed words.</p>

			<p><strong>For example</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">你的公寓在几楼</span>？Nǐde gōngyù zài jǐlóu? (Which floor is your apartment on?)
				</li>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我的公寓在五楼。</span>Wǒde gōngyù zài wǔlóu. (My apartment is on the fifth floor.)</li>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">你家的房子有几个浴室？</span>Nǐjiā de fángzi yǒu jǐgè yùshì? (How
					many bathrooms does your house have?)</li>
				<li><span lang="zh-Hans">我家的房子有三个浴室。</span>Wǒjiā de fángzi yǒu sāngè yùshì. (My house has three bathrooms.)</li>
