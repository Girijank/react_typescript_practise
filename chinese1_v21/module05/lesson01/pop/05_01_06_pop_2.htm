		<p><strong>The Location of a House</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Mountains and water</strong>. These are important elements in feng shui. Choose houses located near large rivers, lakes, or mountains.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Surrounding landscape</strong>. Choose houses located in agreeable landscapes such as gentle slopes. Avoid surroundings that make you feel unpleasant, such as sharp-edged boulders.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Nearby buildings</strong>. Avoid areas where there are sites with strong yin energy flow such as cemeteries, hospitals, prisons, or funeral homes, which break the balance of yin and yang in the house. </li>
                                   <li><strong>Story in a building</strong>. Choose higher floors when selecting apartments to live in, as they help with the flow of energies.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Facing of the house</strong>. Ideally choose houses located in the north with the front facing the south. Avoid houses located in the south with the front facing the north.</li>
