							<p>An apartment is the most common type of
								home in urban China, especially in larger
								cities. This is due to the dense, urban
								population in China. In modern China, you
								can see clusters of apartment buildings
								rising up high in cities. These apartment
								communities are usually well-managed,
								and you can easily find related services
								nearby, such as stores and barbershops.<br>
								<strong>Fun fact</strong>: Apartment buildings usually have
								six, eighteen, or even thirty-three stories.
								Do you want to do some research to find
								out why?</p>
