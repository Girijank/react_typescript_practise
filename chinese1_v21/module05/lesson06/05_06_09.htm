      <h2>Structure Review</h2>
      <p>When introducing your chores, remember to use the structure we learned before. You will need
        this structure for the writing portion of your quiz.</p>
      <p class="text-center">Subject + <span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào (be going to) + verb + object </p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><span lang="zh-Hans">我姐姐要打扫浴室。</span> Wǒ jiějie yào dǎsǎo yùshì. (My older sister is going to clean the bathroom.)</p>
    </div>

  <h2>Your Own Handwritten Chore Chart</h2>
  <p>Now you’ve learned some more chores, let’s see how some of the characters that are written are frequently
    used in the words associated with these chores or related items. You will then be able to create your own
    chore chart on paper in Chinese. How cool! Note: You can also view the stroke sequences of all the
    characters you’ve learned in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> on the <a href="docs/module_05_characters_spreadsheet.pdf"

            <p>Public laundry services are not yet very common in China, due to people’s sometimes
              overly-private discretion on personal hygiene. They are now popular in colleges or
              boarding schools. Young people are starting to welcome the concept because of its
              convenience and efficiency. This is also because many young people live in smaller
              apartments that don’t have enough room for laundry appliances.</p>
