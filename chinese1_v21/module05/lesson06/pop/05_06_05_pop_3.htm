        <p><strong>In My Cousin’s Village</strong></p>
		<ul>
            
        <li>My cousin and her family live in a remote village in Hebei Province. Her parents are working in Shanghai to make more money, so my cousin and her younger brothers are taken care of by their grandparents. My cousin is the oldest child. She does most of the household chores. </li>
        
        <li>My cousin’s house has appliances, such as a television, a fridge, and a washing machine. They don’t have appliances, such as sit-on toilets or showers yet.</li>

        <li>My cousin’s house has two floors. There is a garbage site at the edge of the village where they can dispose off their trash.</li>
        
        <li>People in my cousin’s village normally cook meals at home. My cousin cooks for her grandparents and siblings. They have their own corn field and a garden. When it’s cooking time, she will go to the field to pick fresh vegetables.</li>
        
        <li>In my cousin’s house, preserved meats are commonly used for cooking. They don’t eat out often unless they are invited to a banquet by other villagers. Takeout food is not available there.</li>
