		<p><strong> In My City</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
         <li>My apartment has appliances, such as a fridge, a stove, a microwave, a shower, a toilet, and a washing machine. Some appliances are not common here, such as dishwashers, dryers, bathtubs, and garbage disposals. There is not enough space in our apartment for them. </li>          
 
        <li>There are garbage chutes on each floor in my apartment building. That’s where we dispose off trash. We are required to separate recyclable items.</li>
        
        <li>Both my parents and I eat lunch at work or school. Each day my mom goes to the local market to buy fresh groceries on her way home from work. She cooks when she’s home. When I am home, I help with chores, such as taking out the trash, mopping the floor, putting away groceries, and washing dishes. We often eat out on weekends.</li>
        
        <li>My cousin, who is in her twenties, is always busy. She likes to order takeout food for convenience. She said food takeout is a popular business in cities in China. </li>
        
        <li>My family and I take showers before going to bed. We do house cleaning and laundry on weekends.</li>
