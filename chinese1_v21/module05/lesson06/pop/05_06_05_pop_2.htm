		<p><strong>In My City</strong></p>
		<ul>
         
        <li>My house has appliances including a fridge, stove, shower, toilet, washing machine, and dryer. Dishwashers, bathtubs, and garbage disposals are common in households in my neighborhood.</li>     
    
        <li>We take the trash out every Tuesday morning, and there is a garbage truck coming to collect the trash. We are also required to separate recyclable items.</li>
        
        <li>My mom and I do grocery shopping every Saturday. We also have lunch at work or school. When we get home, my parents cook, and I help with chores, such as setting the table and cleaning the living room. We often eat out in Chinatown on weekends.</li>
        
        <li>There are many takeout services in my neighborhood, such as pizza delivery. People also eat out often, especially for special occasions.</li>
        
        <li>We take showers in the morning before going to work or school. We also do house cleaning and laundry on the weekends.</li>
