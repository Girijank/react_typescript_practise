        <p><strong>In My Cousin’s Town</strong></p>
		<ul>
            
        <li>My cousin lives in a rural town in New Jersey. He lives with his parents, and they all share household responsibilities and chores. His mom does most of the cooking.</li>
        
        <li>My cousin’s house has all the appliances that we have including a fridge, stove, dishwasher, toilet, shower, washing machine, and dryer.</li>

        <li>Similar to us, my cousin’s family takes out the trash can to the street every Thursday morning, and the garbage truck will come and collect it.</li>
        
        <li>My cousin’s family doesn’t eat out very often. There are not many restaurants in their town. There are still chain restaurants that offer takeout.</li>
        
        <li>My cousin’s mom has a greenhouse where she grows some vegetables. But this is mostly for a hobby. They purchase groceries at the local grocery store.</li>
