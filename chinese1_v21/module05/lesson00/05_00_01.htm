				<p>You are making excellent progress in this <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>, and you are almost half way through by now. How awesome! Now more fun is waiting for you ahead. In this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you will equip yourself with the vocabulary and grammar related to describing houses, their interior, and related chores. You will also learn the cultural aspects associated with houses and compare them with your own. After this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you may soon find yourself decorating or arranging your house or room, using some feng shui rules, and talking about it in Chinese. It’ll be cool!</p>
				<p>In this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, we will continue to focus more on Chinese characters than their sound annotations. Just remember that you are still supported with necessary tools or resources to help you recognize and learn the Chinese characters you see. Never hesitate to use the orange globes when you need to. They are there to help! </p>
