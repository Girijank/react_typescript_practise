							<p>The Beijing dialect (<span lang="zh-Hans">北京话</span> Běijīng Huà), also known as Pekingese, is the dialect of Mandarin Chinese generally spoken in urban China. The Beijing dialect is the phonetic basis of the standard Mandarin Chinese; therefore, they are very similar.  A notable difference is that the Beijing dialect uses the “er” sound at the end of certain words. Later in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you will learn more about the Beijing dialect. But if you speak Mandarin Chinese, you will have no trouble getting around in Beijing. </p>
