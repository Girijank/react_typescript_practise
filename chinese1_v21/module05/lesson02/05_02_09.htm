				<p>Isn’t it interesting to learn about the feng shui rules for bedrooms? Now it’s your turn to put them in practice. Check your bedroom to see if it follows any of these feng shui rules. If not, you can consider taking actions to comply with them. Maybe you can speak with your parents about a room re-arrangement project on the weekend. It’ll be fun!</p>
