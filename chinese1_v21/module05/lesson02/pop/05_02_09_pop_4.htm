        <p><strong>Saving Space </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most apartments in my hometown are not very large. My room is quite small. To save space, there are many storage units in my room where space can be found, such as overhead and against the wall.</li> 
            <li>My twin cousin sisters share the same bedroom in their apartment. Their room is not too large either. To save space, they have bunk beds and other space-saving designs such as overhead cabinets and portable closets. </li>
