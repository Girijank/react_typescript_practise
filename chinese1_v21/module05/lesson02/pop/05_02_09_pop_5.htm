        <p><strong>More Feng Shui Rules</strong></p>
        <p>My cousins’ bedroom also complies with some feng shui rules. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The headboard of their bunk beds is not next to a window but placed against a wall, so they are protected from negative energies that might enter through the window, and the wall also brings security.</li>
                <li>There’s a beam on the ceiling in their bedroom which they avoid placing their beds under, since beams symbolize evil oppression or disaster from overhead.</li>
                <li>The bottom of their beds is lifted up from the floor, which protects them from the unpleasant spirits from the ground.</li>
                <li>They have just one or two plants in their bedroom, since too many plants can bring too much yin energy, which can affect their health. </li>
            </ul>
