        <p><strong>Set for Study</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>My desk is near the window, so I can get plenty of natural light when studying. I also have a table lamp on the desk. 
        <li>I have two bookshelves in my bedroom with a lot of space for as many books as I need, since I am preparing for the <em>Gaokao</em> (college entrance exam).</li> 
        <li>The door of my bedroom is soundproof, so I wonâ€™t be disturbed when studying in my room.</li>
            </li>
