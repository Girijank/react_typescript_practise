				<p>Great job moving along in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> with such excellence! You are halfway through this <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span> and getting closer to the finish line. Way to go! So far, you’ve learned how to identify and describe different rooms in a home. You can also identify different furniture items in these rooms, describe their positions or relative locations—as well as various chores related to these rooms. Your vocabulary and knowledge of grammar and culture continue to grow in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. You are amazing!
					</p>
				
				<p>Earlier in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you watched a dialogue video to see how Chinese works in the speaking world. Now let’s review the 
					<a href="../../module05/lesson04/videopop/page04.htm" class="fev_downloadbtn fev_accessibility" target="_blank" role="button" tabindex="0">	<strong>dialogue video</strong></a> to refresh your listening skills.</p>

				<p>Now that you have practiced your listening, speaking, and reading about houses and chores in Chinese, how about we practice writing it? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, let’s explore and refine your writing skills.</p>

		<p>Have you ever created a house plan, or maybe seen one before that is designed for a house or an apartment? In a
			typical house plan, different rooms, doors, and windows are drawn and labeled using Chinese characters, based on their relative locations. Some furniture items are also drawn in each room and labeled using Chinese characters. </p>

		<p>Now that you have learned some feng shui rules that can be applied to the interior of a house, including those
			specifically for bedrooms, living rooms, or kitchens, you may also want to apply one or two of them in your house design. This will be so much fun, and it will come handy before you know it! </p>
