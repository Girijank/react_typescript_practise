				<p>Now let’s put these characters into action. You will create a simple house plan, based on one of the
					scenarios provided
					below. You will then write one or two sentences in English to describe one or two feng shui rules
					you have applied to the
					house design.</p>

				<p>Before creating your own, look at <button type="button"
						class="btn-default fev_singleddbtn" data-toggle="collapse"
						data-target="#answer1"><strong>a sample house plan</strong></button> in Chinese. This is a common house plan in Chinese
					for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. This is for your reference, and you will
					<strong>not</strong> be assessed on the new
					words in this sample house plan. Your plan will be similar to this but simpler.</p>

				<div id="answer1" class="collapse">
					<div class="fev_card">
						<img src="images/m5_l4_p4_img2_flvs.png" alt="Image of a 2-dimentional house plan, including 4 types of rooms in a house or apartment with 2 or more furniture items labeled in Chinese."
							data-width="320px" class="center-block border">
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>When creating the house plan, you can use the characters taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> and/or the characters
					you have learned previously.</p>

				<p>Use the <a href="docs/05.04_my_house_workshop_template.docx"
					class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" target="_blank"> <strong><span class="module_name_tag"></span> Workshop Template</strong></a> for your work. In the template, there are components listed under
					the work area.
					You can move or duplicate these components to fill up the work area. The lines indicate the space
					where you should fill out the names of the components, such as names of the rooms, furniture items,
					doors, and windows.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>At the bottom of your house plan, you will also need to write one or two feng shui rules you have applied to
			your house plan. Use the <a href="docs/resource_feng_shui_rules_review.docx"
				class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" target="_blank"> <strong>feng shui rules review</strong></a> to find the feng shui rule(s) you wish to apply.</p>
		<p>You can also create your own house plan design or look online for an existing template that you like. Again,
			remember that you can “customize” the template of your choice by adding or removing the components to suit
			your own situation. Enjoy the activity!</p>
		<div class="well fev_scenario">
			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario A</h2>
				<p>Create a house plan for your dream single-family house. Your house plan should include at least four
					rooms and at least two furniture items in each room. Also include at least one outdoor component,
					such as a yard. Then, write one or two sentences in English to describe one or two feng shui rules
					you have applied to the house design. </p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="well fev_scenario">
			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario B</h2>
				<p>Create a house plan for your dream apartment. Your house plan should include at least four rooms and
					at least two furniture items in each room. Also include at least one outdoor component, such as a
					balcony. Then, write one or two sentences in English to describe one or two feng shui rules you have
					applied to the house design.</p>

			</div>
		</div>


		<p>Complete the contents of the house plan, using the appropriate characters from the demonstrations from the "Writing Chinese Characters" teaching and/or any other characters you've learned previously. You can choose to
			handwrite the characters or type the characters directly onto a word document and then save the document as
			your work.</p>

		<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to type or handwrite the characters in the worksheet instead of copying and pasting them from
				the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. You are encouraged to handwrite the characters when possible. It is the best way to
				understand the characters. </li>
			<li>For this activity, you can also consider using the characters you’ve learned and used in the previous
				workshops, wherever you see it applicable.</li>
		</ul>
