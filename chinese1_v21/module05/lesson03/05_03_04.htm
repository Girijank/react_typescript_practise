				 <p>In the ancient times, the Chinese Farmers
					Almanac was mostly used to guide farmers’
					activities and for government officials to date
					signing of documents or important events. It is
					now a guide for people’s everyday lives, by telling
					dos and don’ts for each day based on an ancient
					algorithm called Huangdao. Because of the
					difference between the Western calendar and
					lunar calendar, the same Western date on
					different years will fall on different lunar dates.
					Here are some examples:
