			<p>Now you’ve learned the feng shui in the living room and kitchen. Isn’t it cool? Now let’s put these learnings in action. Survey the kitchen and living room in your house very closely. Do they follow any of the feng shui rules you just learned in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? If so, share with your parents what feng shui rules the rooms follow, and if possible, what benefits they bring. If not, you may discuss with your parents about making changes or re-arrangements in the kitchen or living rooms based on some of the feng shui rules. Bring good luck to the common areas of your happy home!</p>
