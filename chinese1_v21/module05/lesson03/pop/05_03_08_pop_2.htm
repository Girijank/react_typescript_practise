		<p><strong>Common Cooking Methods</strong></p>
		<p>Below are some cooking methods my mom and aunts often use to cook.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Baking</strong> — Use dry heat in the oven to cook the ingredients. This is commonly used or bakery items, such as cakes, pies, and tarts.</li>
			<li><strong>Roasting</strong > — Use dry heat and open flame in the oven to cook the ingredients. This is commonly used for meats or certain vegetables.</li>
			<li><strong>Boiling</strong> — Submerge the ingredients in boiling water until they are ready. It is commonly used for meals such as pasta.</li>
			<li><strong>Pan frying</strong> — Fry the ingredients in a shallowly-oiled frying pan. Flip frequently to cook both sides. </li>
		</ul>
