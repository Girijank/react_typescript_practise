		<p>It’s now time to see what you’ve learned in action. Watch the dialogue video to see how the vocabulary and structures you’ve learned so far can be used in real-life settings; then you can apply them in your own daily life.</p>

				<h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
				<p>When viewing the dialogue videos in this course, remember:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Watch each video twice. First, listen through it to see how much you can initially understand. Pay attention to the context and non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements.</li>

					<li>Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything during the first viewing. Make use of the closed captioning to help you understand. Pause the video when necessary so you can have a full view of the sentences in characters or pinyin.</li>

					<li>Feel free to speak along with the dialogue in the video. This will help you build a strong sense of intonations, pronunciations, and cadence in Chinese speech.</li>

					<li>Read the comprehension questions beforehand. Keep the questions in mind while watching the video.</li>

					<li>Answer the questions in your note guide, and then check your answers. <strong>Note</strong>: You will have similar questions on the assessments, so be sure to take the time to practice now.</li>
				</ul>
