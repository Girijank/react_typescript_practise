        <ul>
            <li>We wear school uniforms to PE classes, so we don’t need lockers or have to change our clothes before or after PE classes. We usually don’t take showers on campus. Instead, we take them at home.</li>
            <li>We have regulations for on-campus behavior. For example:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We should raise our hands if we wish to speak during class, and we can talk during discussion time.</li>
                <li>We should sit up straight during class. No feet are allowed on the desk.</li>
                <li>We stand up and greet the teacher at the beginning and the end of a class.</li>
                <li>We greet and bow to a teacher when we run into him or her on campus.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
