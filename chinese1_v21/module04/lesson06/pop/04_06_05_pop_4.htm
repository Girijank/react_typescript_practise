        <p><strong>On-Campus Behavior</strong></p>
		<p>Left, students raising hands in class; middle, a teacher with headset smiling and waving; right, cartoon image of Karen</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have locker rooms where we change for PE classes. There are usually showers in the locker room where we can take showers after PE classes.</li>
            <li>We have rules for on-campus behavior too. Some of them are very similar to yours! For example:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We should raise hands if we wish to speak during class, and we can talk during discussion time, too.</li>
                <li>We should sit attentively during classes. </li>
                <li>We greet our teacher when we walk into his or her classroom.</li>
                <li>We greet a teacher when we run into him or her on campus.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
