		<ul>
			<li>Public and private schools here mostly require school uniforms. They are usually blue, red, or black, sometimes with white or yellow stripes. They are usually in a sports, casual style, so we don’t have to change for PE classes.</li>
			<li>Some schools offer short-sleeved shirts and shorts/skirts as summer uniforms. During winter, we can wear sweaters underneath the uniformssince the school requires uniforms to be seen. We can also wear overcoats to school and then take them off when we are inside.</li>
			<li>Most schools don’t allow students to wear accessories such as earrings or necklaces. During the school year, we are not allowed to have our hair dyed or curled.</li>
			<li>We mostly wear sneakers to school. We can wear sandals when it’s hot. Slippers are definitely not allowed on campus.</li>
