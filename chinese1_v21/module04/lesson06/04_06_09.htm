		<p>Minyi Wu is a high school student from Taiwan. During this Spring Festival, Minyi’s cousin, Karen Lu from New York, came to visit. They were happy to see each other, and they had a very engaging conversation, comparing schools in their regions. Let’s take a peek at what they discussed.  </p>
		
		<p><strong>Note :</strong> You don’t need to understand the whole narration in Chinese, but you should try to catch familiar words while listening and get familiar with the ups and downs of Chinese speech. </p>


		<p>Review the <button type="button" class="btn-default fev_singleddbtn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer11">listening strategies</button> before you jump into Minyi and Karen’sconversation.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Listen to the audio first without reading the text version. Then listen to it again while reading the text.  </li>
								<li>Listen for vocabulary you have learned or cognates you can recognize. </li>
								<li>Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first. Use context clues to help with comprehension.</li>
								<li>Read the questions ahead of time to help guide your listening.</li>
								<li>Ask yourself comprehension questions as you listen. (Do I really understand that sentence?) Pause the audio when necessary. You can also replay it as many times as you need to.</li>
