				<p>By now you have completed half of the course with excellence. Totally awesome! Now your journey of Chinese learning continues. There are more fun activities waiting for you ahead. In this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you will explore the vocabulary and grammar related to school. You will also learn about what schools are like in the Chinese culture and compare them with your own. Now get your backpack ready. We are going to school in China!</p>
				<p>As you’ve experienced (or observed) so far, the everyday use of the Chinese language primarily involves Chinese characters. People read newspapers and books, send text messages, or browse websites using Chinese characters, without pinyin annotations for their pronunciations. Starting with this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, we will <strong>gradually</strong> move our focus from pinyin to Chinese characters. You will start to see more Chinese text in characters without the companion of pinyin. Don’t panic. You will still find sufficient support throughout your learning in this <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>. You will not be lost.</p>
