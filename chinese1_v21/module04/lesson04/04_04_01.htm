				<p>Outstanding job getting this far. You are more than halfway through this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>. How awesome! You are now able to discuss many aspects of your school life in Chinese. You can now also share the skills you’ve obtained at school with your family or friends. Your vocabulary and knowledge of grammar and culture continue to grow. Way to go! </p>


				<p>Earlier in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span>, you watched a dialogue video to see how Chinese works in the speaking world. Now let’s review the <a href="../../module04/lesson04/videopop/page04.htm" class="fev_downloadbtn" target="_blank" role="button" > <strong>dialogue video</strong></a> to refresh your listening skills. Now that you have practiced your listening, speaking, and reading about family and descriptions in Chinese, how about we practice writing it? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, let’s explore and refine your writing skills.</p>

		<!--s<h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
		<p>After completing this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will be able to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>create a school schedule in Chinese with times and items you need for the classes </li>
			<li>identify the rules for writing Chinese characters</li>

		</ul>-->


		<p>Have you ever created a school schedule? Or maybe you’ve created an activity schedule for your summer holidays to plan your days for activities such as reading books and listening to music. In a typical schedule, you can include the times, the names of the classes or activities, and the supplies or materials you need for each class or activity. With the knowledge you’ve learned by now, you can easily create such a schedule, using Chinese characters. This may be something you can use for the upcoming school year or holidays!</p>
		<!-- <p>Are you familiar with comic strips? What about comic strips in Chinese? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will create a comic strip using Chinese characters. It will be something to show off to your instructor and to your friends.</p> -->
