				<p>Now let’s put these characters into action. You will create a school or activity schedule, based on
					one of the scenarios provided below. You will then write one sentence in Chinese characters to
					describe a skill you’ve obtained or used in one of the classes or activities on your schedule.</p>

					<p>Before creating your own, look at <button type="button" class="btn-default fev_singleddbtn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer1"><strong>a sample schedule</strong></button> in Chinese. This is a common school schedule in Chinese high schools. This is for your reference, and you will <strong>not</strong> be assessed on the new words in this sample schedule. Your schedule will be similar to this but simpler.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<br>
		<p>When creating the school schedule and writing the sentences, you can use the characters taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="module_name">module</span> and/or the characters you’ve learned previously. You are expected to use at least 40 characters to complete your school schedule.</p>
		
		<!-- <p>Select <a href="docs/my_school_workshop_template.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" ><strong>here</strong></a> for a basic template for class or activity schedules. In the template, the English in each grid is the prompt and can be removed once you fill out the grid with Chinese characters.</p> -->

		<p>Use the <a href="docs/my_school_workshop_template.docx" class="fev_downloadbtn" role="button" ><strong>basic template</strong></a> for class or activity schedules. In the template, the English in each grid is the prompt and can be removed once you fill out the grid with Chinese characters.</p>

		<p>You can also create your own schedule design or look online for an existing template that you like. Remember that you can “customize” the template of your choice by adding or removing columns or rows to suit your own situation. Enjoy the activity!</p>

		<div class="well fev_scenario">
			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario A</h2>
				<p>Create a simple schedule for your current school year. Your schedule should cover from Monday
					to Friday. For each day, include at least two classes. For each class, include its start and
					end times and at least one supply for that class. On the bottom of your schedule, write one
					short sentence to introduce a skill you’ve learned or used in one of the classes listed on
					your schedule.
				</p>

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="well fev_scenario">
			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="fev_scenarioTitle">Scenario B</h2>
				<p>Create a simple schedule for your summer break. Your schedule should cover from Monday to
					Friday. For each day, include at least two activities. For each activity, include its start
					and end times and at least one supply for that activity. On the bottom of your schedule,
					write one short sentence to introduce a skill you’ve learned or used in one of the
					activities listed on your schedule.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		

		<p>Complete the contents of the school schedule, using the appropriate characters from the demonstrations on the “Writing Chinese Characters” page and/or any other characters you’ve learned previously. You can choose to handwrite the characters or type the characters directly onto a word document and then save the document as your work. </p>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to type or handwrite the characters in the worksheet instead of copying and pasting them from the <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>. You are encouraged to handwrite the characters when possible. It is the best way to understand the characters.</li>
			<li>For this activity, you can also consider using the characters you’ve learned and used in the previous workshops, wherever you see it applicable.</li>
		</ul>

			<p><strong>Be Creative</strong></p>
			<p>You may choose an image from clipart, a picture, or a drawing of your own as the background or decoration for your schedule. </p>
