		<ul>
			<li>There are four columns of desks in my classroom. We used to have two-seat desks, so we each had a “desk mate.” Now we have single desks, but sometimes we place them together to save space in the classroom.</li>
			<li>We rotate seat columns at the end of each week, so each student gets to see the board from different angles to help protect our eyesight..</li>
			<li>Our desks usually have a container underneath the surface where we can store our personal belongings and books since we stay in the same classroom all day and have fixed seats.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>There are 4–5 columns of desks in my classroom. We all have single-seat desks. We have 25–30 students in each class. Some classes are set up in a circle to promote discussions.</li>
			<li>Our teachers in different classrooms also rotate seats for students. But they usually do it only quarterly. </li>
			<li>In the beginning of a school year, we each are assigned a locker where we can store our personal belongings and textbooks. Since we go to different classrooms after each break, we switch out different textbooks from the locker during breaks. </li>
