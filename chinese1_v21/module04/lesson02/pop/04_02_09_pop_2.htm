			<li>My classmates and I stay in the same classroom as we move up in grade levels. We know each other very well, and we often do things together such as cleaning and decorating the classrooms, or we do homework together.</li>

			<li>I sit with different classmates during different classes. I have a few close friends at school, and I share some classes with them. I joined the school chess club with two of my friends. We also do homework together sometimes.</li>
