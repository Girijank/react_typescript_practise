			<li>My school has three main buildings. It has a five-story building with all the classrooms and a three-story building with administrators’ and teachers’ offices. Another three-story building contains all the multipurpose rooms such as computer rooms and science labs.</li>
			<li>Some of my classmates walk to school if they live close by. Some take public transportation to school. Some schools have dorms for students whose homes are too far.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>My school has one large building complex in which there are sections such as classrooms and teachers’ lounges, front office and administrators’ offices, and other sections such as gym, labs, and janitors’ storage rooms. </li>
			<li>Most of my classmates come to school by parent drop-off or by school bus. Not many students walk to school because it’s usually too far. We don’t have dorms on campus.</li>
