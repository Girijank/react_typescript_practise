		    <p>So far, you’ve learned two words that means “or”: <span lang="zh-Hans">或是</span> huòshì and <span lang="zh-Hans">还是</span> háishì. Do you know when to use which one?</p>	
		   <ul>
			   <li><span lang="zh-Hans">或是</span> <strong>huòshì</strong> is used when using “or” in a statement. For example:</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">我用筷子<strong>或是</strong>勺子吃米饭。</span> Wǒ yòng kuàizi <strong>huòshì</strong> sháozi chī mǐfàn. I use chopsticks <strong>or a</strong> spoon to eat rice.</p>

			 </p>
			 <ul>
				 <li><span lang="zh-Hans">还是</span> <strong>háishì</strong> is used when providing choices in a question. For example:</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p><span lang="zh-Hans">你喝咖啡<strong>还是</strong>喝热茶</span>？Nǐ hē kāfēi <strong>háishì</strong> hē rèchá?
				Do you drink coffee <strong>or</strong> drink hot tea?</p>

	  <p>Remember the <strong>Friends for Life</strong>, Kailan Zhang from Beijing and Karen Lu from New York, talking about their different experiences in classroom settings, daily schedules, and learning focuses? Karen becomes curious about Kailan’s narration on how students in China are responsible for the classroom chores. Then Kailan gives more details on how student committees work in schools in China. Select the images to learn more through her narrations.</p>

						<p>Classes in schools in China usually have large enrollments. The average size of a class usually ranges from 45 to 55 students, depending on the availability of teachers and seats in classrooms. Teachers usually need assistance from students to help organize and manage classes. Student committees are common in schools in China. </p>

				<h4>Benefits of being on a student committee</h4>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Evaluation of students in China is merit-based. Students need to excel in all areas, including academic, sports, virtues, congeniality, and so on. Being part of a student committee gives a student the opportunity to apply their organizational skills and become role models for other students. Having experiences in the student committee will also give them an advantage when going to college for being class leaders.</p>
