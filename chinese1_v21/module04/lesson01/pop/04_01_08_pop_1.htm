			<li>We normally start school around 7:30 a.m.</li>
			<li>We have four 45-minute classes in the morning, and then we have a long lunch break from 12 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Many students use this time to take a nap. Then we have classes again from 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.</li>
			<li>Some schools also offer evening study time in the classrooms during exam seasons.</li>
