			<li>At my school, students stay in the same classroom all day. Teachers prepare <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>s in their offices, and then go to different classrooms to teach.</li>
			<li>Students are responsible for the cleaning and decoration of the classrooms. Every Friday afternoon, all the students tidy up their classrooms and have a competition on which classroom is the cleanest.</li>
			<li>Because classmates spend time together in the same classroom, we have very close relationships that last a lifetime.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>At my school, each teacher has his or her own classroom, and students move around to take classes.</li>
			<li>The teachers usually decorate their classrooms with posters related to the subject. We have school janitors who clean up the classrooms at the end of each school day.</li>
			<li>We may have different classmates for different subject classes, instead of a fixed group. This way we make more friendsâ€”sometimes even through different grade levels.</li>
