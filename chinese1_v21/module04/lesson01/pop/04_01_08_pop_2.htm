		<ul>
			<li>There are three years in my high school. </li>
			<li>In the 2nd year, we will choose our future focus among humanities, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), or art majors. Then we will take different courses and apply for different college majors.</li>
			<li>Before graduation, we will take a nationwide annual college entrance exam called “Gaokao.” Many take it very seriously and consider it a life-changing event.</li>
		</ul>

         <p><strong>Karen</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are four years in my high school.</li>
			<li>We usually select different courses throughout the years to build our Grade Point Average (GPA), which is important when we apply for colleges. </li>
			<li>Some students take Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) exams during the 3rd year. It is also a nationwide exam, but we can take it multiple times during the year and use the overall best score. </li>
