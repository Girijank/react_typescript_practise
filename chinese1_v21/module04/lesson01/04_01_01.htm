				<p>Welcome to the second <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span> of this course. You are halfway done, and there are more exciting learning opportunities waiting for you ahead. </p>
				<p>The everyday use of Chinese language often involves Chinese characters without pinyin annotations. As you are halfway through the course, you will start to prepare for real-life situations by reading Chinese characters only. </p>
				<p>Let’s look at the following two examples; one a text message from a new friend, and the other from a restaurant’s advertisement flyer—both of which use Chinese characters without pinyin annotations. You can select the globe next to them to reveal their pinyin and English meanings for support.</p>

		<p><span lang="zh-Hans">晚上好！你的生日是什么时候？很高兴认识你。</span><button type="button" class="btn-default translation no-arrow"

			<div id="t1" class="collapse">
				<div class="card-panel translated">
					<p>Wǎnshàng hǎo! Nǐde shēngrì shì shénme shíhòu? Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.</p>
					<p>Good evening! When is your birthday? Very nice to meet you.</p>
				</div>

			<p><span lang="zh-Hans">我们有热茶，也有冷咖啡。现金买单。</span><button type="button" class="btn-default translation no-arrow"
				data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#t2"></button></p>
				<div id="t2" class="collapse">
					<div class="card-panel translated">
						<p>Wǒmen yǒu rèchá, yěyǒu lěng kāfēi. Xiànjīn mǎidān.</p>
						<p>We have hot tea, and we also have cold coffee. Pay with cash.</p>

		<p>How did you do? In this <span class="lang" data-term="segment_name">segment</span>, remember to keep an eye out for the globe whenever you need support on pinyin and English meanings, but always try to read the Chinese characters first. You will be surprised just how much you understand!</p>

		<p>Imagine you are visiting a friend who has come from China, and you two want to discuss how similar or different your school lives are. How will you have that conversation? Can you describe your daily schedules, including the time of classes in different subjects? How will your classroom setting compare with your friend’s? In this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will learn all about it. Time for school!</p>
		
		<p>After this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>, you will be able to have informative, interesting, and meaningful conversations with your friend about your schools. Now you will know each other even more. Isn’t that wonderful?!</p>
