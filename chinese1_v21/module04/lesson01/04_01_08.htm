			<p>Have you been wondering how classes or classrooms are set up in China, and how similar or different they are compared to your own? Let’s hear the <strong>Friends for Life </strong>narrations from two friends, Kailan Zhang from Beijing, and Karen Lu from New York, about what their class settings are like as compared to each other.</p>

			<p>What an awesome journey!  You can now discuss your class schedules with someone. You can talk about what time you have different classes, and you are now aware of the differences and similarities between class setup in China and in the U.S. How wonderful!</p>
			<p>Let’s keep the fun going by implementing your learning to actual life. Here are two missions for you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you have a favorite school subject that is not taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? If so, ask your instructor how to say that particular subject in Chinese. You will then tell your friends your favorite school subject(s) in Chinese.</li>
				<li>Compare your own class and classroom setup with that of Kailan or Karen, focusing on three aspects: classroom setup, daily time schedule, and selection of learning focus. Then tell a family member or friend how similar or different they are. Enjoy the activities!</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Say two sentences about what you plan to do or where you plan on going, using <span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào (to want to) and/or <span lang="zh-Hans">去</span> qù (to go to) in the sentences.</li>
				<li>Tell your family member or friend the time at the moment in Chinese.</li>
				<li>Explain how to pronounce “üe” in Chinese, and compare the letter sounds to similar pronunciation(s) in your own language.</li>
