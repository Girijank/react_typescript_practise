        <!-- <p><strong>Kailan</strong></p> -->
		<p>Two students, Kailan and Karen, discussing school schedules.</p>
		<p>Top: a group of students talking and laughing in classroom; bottom: a girl with long hair playing chess with someone</p>
        <p>During our homeroom time, we go over class matters with our homeroom teachers. We often spend time outdoors to relax our eyes. We usually do evening study at home or a friendâ€™s home.</p>
        <p>We take English language arts, mathematics (geometry), social studies (world history), science (chemistry), health and safety, physical education, and foreign language as an elective.</p>
        <p>At school we also have the Debate Club and MUN Club, plus English Literature Club and Chess Club. We also have football teams and cheerleading teams. Extracurricular activities are available schoolwide, and there is time assigned for them. </p>
