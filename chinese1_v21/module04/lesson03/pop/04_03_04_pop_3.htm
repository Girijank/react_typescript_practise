        <!-- <p><strong>Kailan</strong></p> -->
		<p>Two students, Kailan and Karen, discussing school schedules.</p>
		<p>Top: three students standing in front of a blackboard; bottom: two young students playing chess</p>
        <p>During the morning reading, we read out loud from Chinese or English textbooks. We do eye exercises every day. We do evening study at school, administered by our homeroom teachers.</p>
        <p>At school we take Chinese, English, mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology for STEM focus, and Chinese, English, mathematics, politics, geography, and history for Humanities focus. These are required courses.</p>
        <p>At school we have the Debate Club, Model United Nations (MUN) Club, Science Club, Chinese Chess Club, etc. But we need to prepare for Gaokao (the national college entrance exam), so extracurricular activities are limited. </p>
