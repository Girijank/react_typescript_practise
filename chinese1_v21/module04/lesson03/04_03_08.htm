		<div class="panel">
			  <p>You’ve learned <span lang="zh-Hans">需要</span> xūyào (to need), the 2nd character of which, <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào (need to)</strong>, can be used to form positive imperative sentences.    </p>
			  <p><strong>For example: </strong></p>
				 <p><span lang="zh-Hans">上音乐课要唱歌。</span>Shàngy īnyuèkèyàochànggē.
					(You) need to sing in music class.
				 </p>
				
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: Imperative sentences in Chinese don’t always require a subject (you). </p>

		<div class="panel">
			  <p>By adding <span lang="zh-Hans">不</span> bù (not) before <span lang="zh-Hans">要</span> yào (to need to), you have the phrase <span lang="zh-Hans">不要</span> bùyào (do not), with which you can form negative imperative sentences.</p>
			  <p><strong>For example: </strong></p>	
				  <p><span lang="zh-Hans">上数学课不要说话</span>。Shàngs hùxuékè <strong>bùyào</strong> shuōhuà.
					Do not talk in math class.					
				  </p>	  
				  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sometimes a character’s tone is changed when it is spoken in a word. You will learn more about this in the future. </p>
