				<p>Have you ever wondered how diets and meals are different in each culture? Let’s compare the diets and
					typical meals of two teens from different cultural backgrounds. Let’s meet Lili and Jack. Lili lives
					in Beijing, China, and Jack lives in Orlando, Florida. They met a junior chef camp last summer and
					are sharing a little bit about their cultures. Let’s see what they have to say about their own
					experiences with the diets.</p>
