			<p>Isn’t it amazing that you are now able to converse about some food items in Chinese and express your preferences on them? Don’t stop here. Let’s explore more.</p>
			<p>Consider what your own diet is like at home or in your own culture. Have you noticed any food or drink items that you haven’t learned in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? Also, how is your own diet different from the Chinese diet that’s introduced in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? Here are some missions for you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is your favorite food taught in this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span>? If not, make a short list of foods you want to know, and ask your instructor how to say them. Now you can say any of your favorite food(s) in Chinese.</li>
				<li>Compare your own diet with a typical Chinese diet. Pay special attention to the types of foods or drinks you may also see in a typical Chinese diet. Have you found anything interesting? You can share these findings with your instructor.</li>

			<h2>Think and Apply</h2>
			<p><span lang="zh-Hans"><em>祝贺你</em></span>！<em>Zhùhè nǐ!</em> Congratulations! You’ve tackled this <span class="lang" data-term="lesson_name">lesson</span> with excellence! Now do you think you can showcase to a family member or friend what you’ve learned, maybe at a family dinner table? You can showcase and teach your family or friend the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Say one type of meat in Chinese.</li>
				<li>State your favorite vegetable using a complete sentence in Chinese.</li>
				<li>Ask your family or friend their preference between two fruits in Chinese.</li>
				<li>Explain how to pronounce “c” in Chinese, and compare it to similar pronunciation(s) in your own language.</li>
				<li>Tell a fact about the Chinese diet that you find interesting, and compare it with your own culture’s diet.</li>
