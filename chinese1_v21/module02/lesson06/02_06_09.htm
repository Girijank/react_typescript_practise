		<p><strong>How to use <span lang="zh-Hans">多少钱</span> duōshǎo qián (how much) in a sentence</strong></p>


		<p>In <span lang="zh-Hans">多少钱</span> duōshǎo qián (how much), the character <span lang="zh-Hans">钱</span>qián means “money.” When asking the price, use the structure “item + <span lang="zh-Hans">多少钱</span>duōshǎo qián + number + measure word” or “number + measure word + item + <span lang="zh-Hans">多少钱</span> duōshǎo qián.” </p>

		<p>For example, “How much for an apple?” can be:</p>

		<p><span lang="zh-Hans">苹果<strong>多少钱</strong>一个？</span>Píngguǒ <strong>duōshǎoqián</strong> yīgè? </p>

		<p>or</p>

		<p><span lang="zh-Hans">一个苹<strong>果多少钱</strong></span>？Yīgè píngguǒ <strong>duōshǎoqián</strong>?</p>
