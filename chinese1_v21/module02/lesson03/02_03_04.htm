      <p>Remember Lili and Jack? Lili lives in Beijing, China, and Jack lives in Orlando, Florida. They met at a junior chef camp last summer. They are continuing to chat on the phone to share experiences with their own cultures. Recently Lili attended a banquet for her grandma’s 80th birthday celebration, and she shared some fun facts she observed during the banquet.</p>

            <li>My aunt hosted the banquet. When we entered the room, she seated my grandma in the center seat that faces the entrance. My mom said that is called the “command seat,” and the person who has the highest social ranking sits there. My aunt told me that in the Chinese tradition, social ranking is usually decided by one’s age, power, or wealth.</li>
            <li>After my grandma was seated, all my relatives started to take seats. I noticed that they were seated by their seniorities in the family. My uncles sat closer to my grandma as they have higher social ranking, while the kids sat on the other side of the table.</li>
            <li>My aunt was at the entrance the whole time to arrange seating for everyone. Then she sat at the seat closest to the kitchen, which was the least important seat. </li>

            <li>My grandma lifted her chopsticks to signal the start of the feast. After she started eating, everyone else then lifted their chopsticks to start eating.</li>
            <li>While eating, my mom told me that I needed to pick up my bowl of rice, instead of leaning over the table to eat, which is considered bad manners.</li>
            <li>My mom also warned me not to hog all the food, and always be mindful there’s enough for everyone to share. She said it’s important to consider others during feasts in China.</li>
            <li>During the banquet, everyone was either chatting or playing finger guessing games. My cousin sitting next to me told me that those are common social activities during banquets, and it’s considered bad manners to just look at your phone or watch TV while you eat.</li>

            <li>I noticed that when my aunt came to pour tea in my cousin’s cup, my cousin tapped the table several times with her first two fingers. She told me this was to show appreciation and to indicate there’s enough tea poured.</li>
            <li>During the feast, my mom kept reminding me to keep my mouth closed when chewing and to chew slowly to show elegance.</li>
            <li>My mom also reminded me to keep the table area before me clean and tidy. There was a small plate where I could put removed bones or shells instead of scattering them all over.</li>
            <li>Everyone was given a toothpick after the meal to clean their teeth. I saw my uncle cover his mouth with his other hand when using the toothpick.</li>

            <li>My mom reminded me not to point at people around the table using the tips of my chopsticks. She said that’s rude.</li>
