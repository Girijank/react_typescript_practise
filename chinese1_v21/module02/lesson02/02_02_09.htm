It is made by boiling stalks and leaves of Chinese mesona, a type of mint family plant, and cooled with starch to be jelly-like.

            <p>Dragon beard candy is a traditional Chinese dessert made of peanuts, coconut, sesame seeds, sugar, and glutinous rice flour. It’s known as the Chinese version of cotton candy. It’s made by stretching the rice flour dough into small and thin strands. Such strands, when eaten, can stick to one’s face easily, and that’s how it gets its name. </p>
