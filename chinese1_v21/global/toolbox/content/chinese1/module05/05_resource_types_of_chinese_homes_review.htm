          An apartment is the most common type of home in urban China, especially in the larger cities. This is due to the dense, urban population in China. In modern China, you can see clusters of apartment buildings rising up high in the cities. These apartment communities are usually well-managed, and you can easily find related services nearby, such as stores and barbershops. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Apartment buildings usually have six, eighteen, or even thirty-three stories. Do you want to do some research to find out why?</p>

          Single-family houses or townhouses are most commonly seen in suburban areas in China. They usually have extras like a garage, yard, balcony, and porch. Single-family houses are usually expensive, especially when located near the city. With large cities becoming more and more crowded, many people choose to live in single-family houses in the suburbs and commute to work in the city.</p>

          Tulou, meaning “earth building,” is a type of rural home unique to the Hakka people in the Fujina province in China. It is usually a large, enclosed, circular or square building with very thick earth walls. A tulou usually has three to five stories and can hold up to 800 dwellers. Several tulous are usually built together. A typical setup is four round tulous and a square one. People usually nickname such a setup as “<span lang="zh-Hans">四菜一汤</span> Sìcài yītāng (four dishes and one soup),” the configuration of a typical Chinese family meal.</p>

          A Dai bamboo house is a type of dwelling unique to the Dai people in Southern China, especially in the Yunnan Province. The house is built on stilts to fend off wild animals, such as snakes, due to the hot and humid local weather.  It is built with bamboo and similar materials, and it has open floorplans with seven to eight-foot-high ceilings on the lower floor to improve air circulation inside. In the middle of the lower floor, there is usually a fireplace that burns day and night. The design is simple, and the construction is easy. A bamboo house can be built in just a few days.

        <td><p>A yurt is a portable circular tent used by the nomadic Mongolian ethnic group as dwellings. It is made of thick skins or felt for insulation. The size of a yurt is decided by how many sectors of skins or felt are used. A regular family uses six to eight sectors. The door of a yurt opens to the southeast, following feng shui, because bad luck and fierce winds usually come from the north or northwest. Inside a yurt, the seniors of a family dwell in the center and on the west side, while the young dwell on the east side. The fireplace is in the center with an opening in the ceiling for the chimney. A yurt is easy to set up and to transport. It takes two to three hours to set it up, and two camels can carry it with no difficulty.</p>

        <td><p><em>Yaodong,</em> also known as a “house cave,” is a type of dwelling typical of northwestern China, especially in the Shanxi province. It is an indentation carved out of the side of a hill, using the surrounding earth as insulation. This keeps the inside of a <em>Yaodong</em> cool in the summers and warm in the winters. A typical <em>Yaodong</em> usually includes three to five individual rooms, each about 25 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high. Inside a <em>Yaodong</em>, there is usually a built-in heated brick platform called a <span lang="zh-Hans">炕</span> kàng, where people work, eat, and sleep.</p>
