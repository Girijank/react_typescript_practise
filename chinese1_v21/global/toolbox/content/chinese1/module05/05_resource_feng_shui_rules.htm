        <h2>Chinese 1 Feng Shui Rules Review</h2>

        <p><strong>Basic Concepts of Feng Shui</strong></p>

        <ul>
           <li>Feng shui is an ancient Taoism philosophy and its practice of planning and arranging a living space to reach a balance with the natural world.</li>
           <li>Practicing feng shui involves using an octagon-shaped map called a 八卦Bāguà (bagua). It indicates the distribution of different energies and how they flow. </li>
           <li>The study of feng shui involves the five elements: earth, wood, metal, water, and fire and the aspects of human lives they represent.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p><strong>The Location of a House</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mountains and water. These are important elements in feng shui. Choose houses located near large rivers, lakes, or mountains.</li>
            <li>Surrounding landscape. Choose houses located in agreeable landscapes such as gentle slopes. Avoid surroundings that make you feel unpleasant, such as sharp-edged boulders.</li>
            <li>Nearby buildings. Avoid areas where there are sites with strong yin energy flow such as cemeteries, hospitals, prisons, or funeral homes, which break the balance of yin and yang in the house.</li>
            <li>Story in a building. Choose higher floors when selecting apartments to live in, as they help with the flow of energies.</li>
            <li>Facing of the house. Ideally choose houses located in the north with the front facing the south. Avoid houses located in the south with the front facing the north.</li>
            
        </ul>
      
        <p><strong>Feng Shui Rules for the Outside</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose houses that have buildings on both its left and right sides with the same height. This indicates good support.</li>
            <li>Avoid L-shaped houses or buildings.</li>
            <li>Avoid houses or buildings at the end of a road.</li>
            <li>Avoid buildings with sharp eaves or gables.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A bright and large living room is best with a cozy and private bedroom.</li>
            <li>The front door should open to an entrance area next to the living room. Avoid front doors that open to the bathroom, kitchen, or bedroom.</li>
            <li>The house should be rectangular or square shaped. Avoid triangle-shaped houses or buildings.</li>
            <li>Doors inside a house should not face each other.</li>
            <li>The living room furniture should follow rectangular lines, and they should be placed against the walls.</li>
            <li>Avoid placing sharp or unknown items in the house.</li>
            <li>Avoid decorative lights that have too many colors.</li>
            <li>The sofa shouldn’t directly face the front door.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Feng Shui Rules for Bedrooms</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bedrooms should be rectangular since irregular shapes may cause tension.</li>
            <li>Bedroom doors shouldn’t face the house entrance, so good luck, health, and fortune won’t escape.</li>
            <li>Bedroom doors shouldn’t face the bathroom door, so any unwanted odors won’t enter.</li>
            <li>Bedrooms shouldn’t be next to the kitchen, so the heat won’t make the room uncomfortable or too hot.</li>
            <li>A mirror may be hung at the bedroom door facing outwards, so it repels evil spirits.</li>
            <li>If there’s a beam on the ceilings in a bedroom, the bed shouldn’t be placed right under it, since beams symbolize evil oppression or disaster from overhead.</li>
            <li>The bottom of beds should be lifted up from the floor, which protects the sleeper(s) from the unpleasant spirits from the ground.</li>
            <li>A few plants can be placed in the bedroom, but too many plants can bring too much yin energy, which can affect the dweller(s)’ health.</li>
        </ul>	
        
        <p><strong>Kitchen Feng Shui</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The kitchen should not be an irregular shape because it is believed to affect the family’s health.</li>
            <li>The stove should not face the kitchen door, and the kitchen should not face the front door of the house.</li>
            <li>The stove should not be facing or right next to the sink because elements fire and water are not compatible.</li>
            <li>The stove should not be in the center of the kitchen. Too much heat in the center will cause disharmony in the family.</li>
            <li>Avoid placing mirrors in the kitchen. If there is one, it should not reflect the stove flames, which is believed to bring fire or misfortune to the house.</li>
            <li>In the kitchen, knives should not be hung on the wall nor be in plain sight. They should be concealed in places such as drawers.</li>
            <li>Garlic, onion, and peppers should also be hidden in the kitchen. These items absorb yin energy, which will affect the family’s health.</li>
            <li>The fridge and rice/food jars should be kept in the kitchen, and they should be filled with food all the time to symbolize abundance. It also helps bring fortune to put three Chinese coins in a red packet and place it in the rice/food jar.</li>
            <li>The kitchen should not be next to the bathroom to avoid the unclean air coming from the bathroom to contaminate the meals.</li>
            <li>The kitchen floor should be lower than the living room or bedroom.</li>
            <li>The kitchen should not be placed between two bedrooms. It brings misfortune to the people living in them.</li>
            <li>The washing machine should not be placed in the kitchen, so the unclean water flow will not mix with meals.</li>
            <li>Indoors stairs in multi-level houses should not directly face the kitchen. This will cause unnecessary troubles for the family.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Living Room Feng Shui</strong></p>

        <ul>
           <li>It is good luck to have the living room at the center of the house.</li>
           <li>The living room should not have a sharp corner or edge facing the front door. If so, a plant can be placed there to conceal it.</li>
           <li>The shape of the living room should be square or rectangular. Irregular shaped living rooms can be improved with plants, furniture, or dividers.</li>
           <li>The facing of living rooms is decided by which direction its windows open to. Living rooms facing south should be painted in white; facing north, red; facing west, green; and facing east, yellow.</li>
           <li>In the living room, the corner diagonal to the house’s front door is usually called the “fortune spot.” A sofa can be placed at the fortune spot. Sitting there often can bring you good fortune. You can also place a plant at the fortune spot. Avoid placing anything there that vibrates, such as a stereo system. It will affect your fortune.</li>
           <li>In the living room, end tables should be round-shaped. They should be placed next to a sofa but should not be larger than the sofa.</li>
           <li>Having a fish tank in the living room is good. But avoid placing it behind a sofa or on the “fortune spot.” This will cause good fortune to flow away.</li>
           <li>Avoid white pillars in the living room. They resemble a white candle, which symbolizes funerals.</li>
           <li>Paintings of plants or amiable animals can be hung in the living room. If hanging a landscape painting, be sure the water/landscape flow in the painting points toward the inside the house, not outside. If hanging a vicious animal painting such as tiger or lion, be sure the head of the animal in the painting points toward the outside of the house, not inside.</li>
        </ul>
